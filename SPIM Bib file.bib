               benefit of optical sectioning to study, with minimal
               photobleaching, thick samples allowing us to measure the
               diffusivity of colloidal particles at high volume fractions.
               Further, SPIDDM exploits the inherent spatially-varying
               thickness of Gaussian light-sheets. Where the excitation sheet
               is most focused, we capture high spatial frequency dynamics as
               the signal-to-background is high. In thicker regions, we capture
               the slower dynamics as diffusion out of the sheet takes longer.",

                 to the vanguard of gene therapy. Numerous naturally occurring
                 serotypes have been used to target cells in various tissues.
                 There is a strong need for fast and dynamic methods which
                 efficiently unravel viral tropism in whole organs.
                 Ultramicroscopy (UM) is a novel fluorescence microscopy
                 technique that images optically cleared undissected specimens,
                 achieving good resolutions at high penetration depths while
                 being non-destructive. UM was applied to obtain
                 high-resolution 3D analysis of AAV transduction in adult mouse
                 brains, especially in the hippocampus, a region of interest
                 for Alzheimer's disease therapy. We separately or
                 simultaneously compared transduction efficacies for commonly
                 used serotypes (AAV9 and AAVrh10) using fluorescent reporter
                 expression. We provide a detailed comparative and quantitative
                 analysis of the transduction profiles. UM allowed a rapid
                 analysis of marker fluorescence expression in neurons with
                 intact projections deep inside the brain, in defined
                 anatomical structures. Major hippocampal neuronal transduction
                 was observed with both vectors, with slightly better efficacy
                 for AAV9 in UM. Glial response and synaptic marker expression
                 did not change post transduction.We propose UM as a novel
                 valuable complementary tool to efficiently and simultaneously

  abstract    = "Light wavelengths preferentially absorbed by chlorophyll (chl)
                 often display steep absorption gradients. This over-saturates
                 photosynthesis in upper chloroplasts and deprives lower
                 chloroplasts of blue and red light. Reducing chl content could
                 create a more even leaf light distribution and thereby
                 increase leaf light-use efficiency and overall canopy
                 photosynthesis. This was tested on soybean cultivar 'Clark'
                 (WT) and a near-isogenic chl b deficient mutant, Y11y11, grown
                 in controlled environment chambers and in the field. Light
                 attenuation was quantified using a novel approach involving
                 light sheet microscopy. Leaf adaxial and abaxial surfaces were
                 illuminated separately with blue, red, and green wavelengths,
                 and chl fluorescence was detected orthogonally to the
                 illumination plane. Relative fluorescence was significantly
                 greater in deeper layers of the Y11y11 mesophyll than in WT,
                 with the greatest differences in blue, then red, and finally
                 green light when illuminated from the adaxial surface. Modeled
                 relative photosynthesis based on chlorophyll profiles and
                 Beer's Law predicted less steep gradients in mutant relative
                 photosynthesis rates compared to WT. Although photosynthetic
                 light-use efficiency was greater in the field-grown mutant
                 with ~50\% lower chl, light-use efficiency was lower in the
                 mutant when grown in chambers where chl was ~80\% reduced.
                 This difference is probably due to pleiotropic effects of the
                 mutation that accompany very severe reductions in chlorophyll
                 and may warrant further testing in other low-chl lines.",

                 macromolecular complexes to interchromatin corrals.
                 Herpesvirus capsids of approximately 125 nm assemble in the
                 nucleoplasm and must reach the nuclear membranes for egress.
                 Previous studies concluded that nuclear herpesvirus capsid
                 motility is active, directed, and based on nuclear filamentous
                 actin, suggesting that large nuclear complexes need metabolic
                 energy to escape nuclear entrapment. However, this hypothesis
                 has recently been challenged. Commonly used microscopy
                 techniques do not allow the imaging of rapid nuclear particle
                 motility with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we
                 use a rotating, oblique light sheet, which we dubbed a
                 ring-sheet, to image and track viral capsids with high
                 temporal and spatial resolution. We do not find any evidence
                 for directed transport. Instead, infection with different
                 herpesviruses induced an enlargement of interchromatin domains
                 and allowed particles to diffuse unrestricted over longer
                 distances, thereby facilitating nuclear egress for a larger
                 fraction of capsids.",

                 Particularly suitable for such studies is the application of

  abstract  = "The various benefits of light sheet microscopy have made it a
               widely used modality for capturing three-dimensional images. It
               is mostly used for fluorescence imaging, but recently another
               technique called light sheet tomography solely relying on
               scattering was presented. The method was successfully applied to
               imaging of plant roots in transparent soil, but is limited when
               it comes to more turbid samples. This study presents a polarised
               light sheet tomography system and its advantages when imaging in
               highly scattering turbid media. The experimental configuration
               is guided by Monte Carlo radiation transfer methods, which model
               the propagation of a polarised light sheet in the sample. Images
               of both reflecting and absorbing phantoms in a complex
               collagenous matrix were acquired, and the results for different
               polarisation configurations are compared. Focus scanning methods
               were then used to reduce noise and produce three-dimensional
               reconstructions of absorbing targets.",

                 imaging on a conventional inverted microscope. The PIP device
                 allowed the integration of microscope with tunable laser sheet
                 profile, fast image acquisition, and 3-D scanning. The device
                 is both compact, measuring approximately 15 by 5 by 5 cm, and
                 cost-effective, since we employed consumer electronics and an
                 inexpensive device molding method. We demonstrated that PIP
                 provided significant contrast and resolution enhancement to
                 conventional microscopy through imaging different
                 multi-cellular fluorescent structures, including 3-D branched

                   differences in refractive index limits the depth of optical
                   imaging systems. Two-photon microscopy (2PM), which
                   significantly reduces the scattering of the excitation
                   light, has emerged as the most common method to image deep
                   within scattering biological tissue. This technique,
                   however, requires high-power pulsed lasers that are both
                   expensive and difficult to integrate into compact portable
                   systems. In this paper, using a combination of theoretical
                   and experimental techniques, we show that Selective Plane
                   Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) can image nearly as deep as
                   2PM without the need for a high-powered pulsed laser.
                   Compared to other single photon imaging techniques like
                   epifluorescence and confocal microscopy, SPIM can image more
                   than twice as deep in scattering media (approximately 10
                   times the mean scattering length). These results suggest
                   that SPIM has the potential to provide deep imaging in
                   scattering media in situations where 2PM systems would be
                   too large or costly.",

                 techniques, such as selective plane illumination microscopy
                 (SPIM), has become a well established method for developmental
                 biology. However, conventional SPIM architectures hardly
                 permit imaging of certain tissues since the common sample
                 mounting procedure, based on gel embedding, could interfere
                 with the sample morphology. In this work we propose an
                 inverted selective plane microscopy system (iSPIM), based on
                 non-linear excitation, suitable for 3D tissue imaging. First,
                 the iSPIM architecture provides flexibility on the sample
                 mounting, getting rid of the gel-based mounting typical of
                 conventional SPIM, permitting 3D imaging of hippocampal slices
                 from mouse brain. Moreover, all the advantages brought by two
                 photon excitation (2PE) in terms of reduction of scattering
                 effects and contrast improvement are exploited, demonstrating
                 an improved image quality and contrast compared to single
                 photon excitation. The system proposed represents an optimal
                 platform for tissue imaging and it smooths the way to the

  abstract    = "In subcellular light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) of
                 adherent cells, glass substrates are advantageously rotated
                 relative to the excitation and emission light paths to avoid
                 glass-induced optical aberrations. Because cells are spread
                 across the sample volume, three-dimensional imaging requires a
                 light-sheet with a long propagation length, or rapid sample
                 scanning. However, the former degrades axial resolution and/or
                 optical sectioning, while the latter mechanically perturbs
                 sensitive biological specimens on pliant biomimetic substrates
                 (e.g., collagen and basement membrane). Here, we use
                 aberration-free remote focusing to diagonally sweep a narrow
                 light-sheet along the sample surface, enabling multicolor
                 imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution. Further, we
                 implement a dithered Gaussian lattice to minimize
                 sample-induced illumination heterogeneities, significantly
                 improving signal uniformity. Compared with mechanical sample
                 scanning, we drastically reduce sample oscillations, allowing
                 us to achieve volumetric imaging at speeds of up to 3.5 Hz for
                 thousands of Z-stacks. We demonstrate the optical performance
                 with live-cell imaging of microtubule and actin cytoskeletal
                 dynamics, phosphoinositide signaling, clathrin-mediated
                 endocytosis, polarized blebbing, and endocytic vesicle
                 sorting. We achieve three-dimensional particle tracking of
                 clathrin-associated structures with velocities up to 4.5
                 $\mu$m/s in a dense intracellular environment, and show that
                 such dynamics cannot be recovered reliably at lower volumetric
                 image acquisition rates using experimental data, numerical
                 simulations, and theoretical modeling.",

  abstract    = "Plants form new organs with patterned tissue organization
                 throughout their lifespan. It is unknown whether this robust
                 post-embryonic organ formation results from stereotypic
                 dynamic processes, in which the arrangement of cells follows
                 rigid rules. Here, we combine modeling with empirical
                 observations of whole-organ development to identify the
                 principles governing lateral root formation in Arabidopsis.
                 Lateral roots derive from a small pool of founder cells in
                 which some take a dominant role as seen by lineage tracing.
                 The first division of the founders is asymmetric, tightly
                 regulated, and determines the formation of a layered
                 structure. Whereas the pattern of subsequent cell divisions is
                 not stereotypic between different samples, it is characterized
                 by a regular switch in division plane orientation. This switch
                 is also necessary for the appearance of patterned layers as a
                 result of the apical growth of the primordium. Our data
                 suggest that lateral root morphogenesis is based on a limited
                 set of rules. They determine cell growth and division
                 orientation. The organ-level coupling of the cell behavior
                 ensures the emergence of the lateral root's characteristic
                 features. We propose that self-organizing, non-deterministic
                 modes of development account for the robustness of plant organ
                 morphogenesis.",

                 multi-dimensional and multi-scale imaging via illuminating
                 specimens with a separate thin sheet of laser. It allows rapid
                 plane illumination for reduced photo-damage and superior axial
                 resolution and contrast. We hereby demonstrate cardiac LSFM
                 (c-LSFM) imaging to assess the functional architecture of
                 zebrafish embryos with a retrospective cardiac synchronization
                 algorithm for four-dimensional reconstruction (3-D space +

                 hypertrabeculation of adult zebrafish hearts in response to

                 assess treatment effects and disease progression. Until now
                 mapping of the tumor vasculature has been difficult. We have

                 partial vascular normalization with decreased vessel caliber,

                 surprisingly little is known on their spatial orchestration at

              axial resolution. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel
              approach to reconstruct fluorescence volumes with isotropic high
              resolution, from images of particle replicates observed at
              multiple orientations. We design a joint
              deconvolution-and-multiview reconstruction approach dedicated to
              three-dimensional fluorescence imaging. We address the
              computational challenge associated to big data by designing a
              fast augmented-Lagrangian optimizer. The computational cost of
              the iterative part of the algorithm does not depend on the number

                 for our understanding of cardiac failures and pave the way for
                 better diagnostics and treatment. However, the constant motion
                 and close incorporation into the cardiovascular system prevent
                 in vivo studies of the living, unperturbed heart. The
                 complementary strengths of the zebrafish model and light sheet
                 microscopy provide a useful platform to fill this gap.
                 High-resolution images of the embryonic vertebrate heart are
                 now recorded from within the living animal: deep inside the
                 unperturbed heart we can follow cardiac contractions and
                 measure action potentials and calcium transients.
                 Three-dimensional reconstructions of the entire beating heart
                 with cellular resolution give new insights into its
                 ever-changing morphology and facilitate studies into how

               highly scattering tissues",
  author    = "Glaser, A K and Wang, Y and T.C. Liu, J",
  abstract  = "Light sheet microscopy (LSM) has emerged as an optical-imaging
               method for high spatiotemporal volumetric imaging of relatively
               transparent samples. While this capability has allowed the
               technique to be highly impactful in fields such as developmental
               biology, applications involving highly scattering thick tissues
               have been largely unexplored. Herein, we employ Monte Carlo
               simulations to explore the use of LSM for imaging turbid media.
               In particular, due to its similarity to dual-axis confocal (DAC)
               microscopy, we compare LSM performance to point-scanned (PS-DAC)
               and line-scanned (LS-DAC) dual-axis confocal microscopy
               techniques that have been previously shown to produce
               high-quality images at round-trip optical lengths of ~9 -- 10
               and ~3 -- 4 respectively. The results of this study indicate
               that LSM using widefield collection (WF-LSM) provides comparable
               performance to LS-DAC in thick tissues, due to the fact that
               they both utilize an illumination beam focused in one dimension
               (i.e. a line or sheet). On the other hand, LSM using confocal
               line detection (CL-LSM) is more analogous to PS-DAC microscopy,
               in which the illumination beam is focused in two dimensions to a
               point. The imaging depth of LSM is only slightly inferior to DAC
               (~2 -- 3 and ~6 -- 7 optical lengths for WF-LSM and CL-LSM
               respectively) due to the use of a lower numerical aperture (NA)
               illumination beam for extended imaging along the illumination
               axis. Therefore, we conclude that the ability to image deeply is
               dictated most by the confocality of the microscope technique. In
               addition, we find that imaging resolution is mostly dependent on
               the collection NA, and is relatively invariant to imaging depth
               in a homogeneous scattering medium. Our results indicate that
               superficial imaging of highly scattering tissues using light
               sheet microscopy is possible.",

              Carlo ray tracing and geometric optics, our method simulates the
              operational aspects and image formation process of the LSFM. This
              simulated, in silico LSFM creates synthetic images of digital
              fluorescent specimens that can resemble those generated by a real
              LSFM, as opposed to established visualization methods producing
              visually-plausible images. We also propose an accurate
              fluorescence rendering model which takes into account the
              intrinsic characteristics of fluorescent dyes to simulate the
              light interaction with fluorescent biological specimen. RESULTS:

                 holography, enables delivery of the light-sheet through a
                 multimode optical fibre - an optical element with extremely
                 small footprint, yet permitting complex control of light
                 transport processes within. We show that this approach
                 supports some of the most advanced methods in light-sheet
                 microscopy: by taking advantage of the cylindrical symmetry of
                 the fibre, we facilitate the wavefront engineering methods for
                 generation of both Bessel and structured Bessel beam plane
                 illumination. Finally, we assess the quality of imaging on a
                 sample of fluorescent beads fixed in agarose gel and we
                 conclude with a proof-of-principle imaging of a biological
                 sample, namely the regenerating operculum prongs of

                 interest in high-speed and large field-of-view volumetric
                 imaging at cellular resolution. Light sheet microscopy
                 approaches have emerged for cellular-resolution functional
                 brain imaging in small organisms such as larval zebrafish, but
                 remain fundamentally limited in speed. Here, we have developed
                 SPED light sheet microscopy, which combines large volumetric
                 field-of-view via an extended depth of field with the optical
                 sectioning of light sheet microscopy, thereby eliminating the
                 need to physically scan detection objectives for volumetric
                 imaging. SPED enables scanning of thousands of
                 volumes-per-second, limited only by camera acquisition rate,
                 through the harnessing of optical mechanisms that normally
                 result in unwanted spherical aberrations. We demonstrate
                 capabilities of SPED microscopy by performing fast

                 volumetrically visualize organisms used in developmental
                 biology and experimental genetics. Ideally suited for imaging
                 transparent samples, SPIM can offer high frame rate imaging
                 with optical microscopy resolutions and low phototoxicity.
                 However, its performance quickly deteriorates when applied to
                 opaque tissues. To overcome this limitation, SPIM optics were
                 merged with optical and optoacoustic (photoacoustic) readouts.
                 The performance of this hybrid imaging system was

                 within living tissues is required to fully understand
                 developmental processes and neural activities. Zebrafish
                 embryos are relatively small and optically transparent, making
                 them the vertebrate model of choice for live in vivo imaging.
                 However, embryonic brains cannot be imaged in their entirety
                 by confocal or two-photon microscopy due to limitations in
                 optical range and scanning speed. Here, we use light-sheet
                 fluorescence microscopy to overcome these limitations and
                 image the entire head of live transgenic zebrafish embryos. We
                 simultaneously imaged cranial neurons and blood vessels during
                 embryogenesis, generating comprehensive 3D maps that provide
                 insight into the coordinated morphogenesis of the nervous

              found applications in diverse fields. An analog in 2D, or

              existing methods suffer from deficiencies. For example, Airy
              beams are not highly localized, some PND beams have significant
              side lobes, and a cosine beam has to be truncated by a very
              narrow aperture thus discarding most of the energy. We show, both

                 embryos is actively studied, but less so how tissue-scale
                 physical forces impact morphogenesis. Here we address the role
                 of the latter during axis extension, using Drosophila germband
                 extension (GBE) as a model. We found previously that cells
                 elongate in the anteroposterior (AP) axis in the extending
                 germband, suggesting that an extrinsic tensile force
                 contributed to body axis extension. Here we further
                 characterized the AP cell elongation patterns during GBE, by
                 tracking cells and quantifying their apical cell deformation
                 over time. AP cell elongation forms a gradient culminating at
                 the posterior of the embryo, consistent with an AP-oriented
                 tensile force propagating from there. To identify the
                 morphogenetic movements that could be the source of this
                 extrinsic force, we mapped gastrulation movements temporally
                 using light sheet microscopy to image whole Drosophila
                 embryos. We found that both mesoderm and endoderm
                 invaginations are synchronous with the onset of GBE. The AP
                 cell elongation gradient remains when mesoderm invagination is
                 blocked but is abolished in the absence of endoderm
                 invagination. This suggested that endoderm invagination is the
                 source of the tensile force. We next looked for evidence of
                 this force in a simplified system without polarized cell
                 intercalation, in acellular embryos. Using Particle Image
                 Velocimetry, we identify posteriorwards Myosin II flows
                 towards the presumptive posterior endoderm, which still
                 undergoes apical constriction in acellular embryos as in
                 wildtype. We probed this posterior region using laser ablation
                 and showed that tension is increased in the AP orientation,
                 compared to dorsoventral orientation or to either orientations
                 more anteriorly in the embryo. We propose that apical
                 constriction leading to endoderm invagination is the source of
                 the extrinsic force contributing to germband extension. This
                 highlights the importance of physical interactions between
                 tissues during morphogenesis.",

                 key to explore anatomy, plasticity, and functionality of the
                 cerebellum. As an example, an in vivo analysis of the dynamic
                 remodeling of cerebellar axons by nonlinear microscopy can
                 provide fundamental insights of the mechanism that promotes
                 neuronal regeneration. Several studies showed that damaged
                 climbing fibers are capable of regrowing also in adult
                 animals. The investigation of the time-lapse dynamics of
                 degeneration and regeneration of these axons within their
                 complex environment can be performed by time-lapse two-photon
                 fluorescence (TPF) imaging in vivo. Here, we show that single
                 axonal branches can be dissected by laser axotomy, thus
                 avoiding collateral damage to the adjacent dendrite and the
                 formation of a persistent glial scar. Despite the very small
                 denervated area, the injured axons consistently reshaped the
                 connectivity with surrounding neurons and sprouted new
                 branches through the intact surroundings. Correlative light
                 and electron microscopy revealed that the sprouted branch
                 contains large numbers of vesicles, with varicosities in the
                 close vicinity of Purkinje dendrites. By using an RNA
                 interference approach, we found that downregulating GAP-43
                 causes a significant increase in the turnover of presynaptic
                 boutons and hampers the generation of reactive sprouts.

                 with novel voltage sensitive dyes or transgenic mice allow
                 optical registrations of action potential across a population
                 of neurons opening promising prospective in understanding
                 brain functionality. Finally, we describe novel
                 implementations of light-sheet microscopy to resolve neuronal
                 anatomy in whole cerebellum with cellular resolution. The
                 understanding gained from these complementary optical methods

                 internalized. It is not understood how the rest of the embryo
                 participates in this process. Here we use multiview selective
                 plane illumination microscopy coupled with infrared laser
                 manipulation and mutant analysis to dissect embryo-scale cell
                 interactions during early gastrulation. Lateral cells have a
                 denser medial-apical actomyosin network and shift ventrally as
                 a compact cohort, whereas dorsal cells become stretched. We
                 show that the behaviour of these cells affects furrow
                 internalization. A computational model predicts different
                 mechanical properties associated with tissue behaviour:
                 lateral cells are stiff, whereas dorsal cells are soft.
                 Experimental analysis confirms these properties in vivo.",

  abstract    = "The proper functioning of the dopaminergic system requires the
                 coordinated formation of projections extending from
                 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), ventral
                 tegmental area (VTA) and retrorubral field to a wide array of
                 forebrain targets including the striatum, nucleus accumbens
                 and prefrontal cortex. The mechanisms controlling the assembly
                 of these distinct dopaminergic cell clusters are not well
                 understood. Here, we have investigated in detail the migratory
                 behavior of dopaminergic neurons giving rise to either the SN
                 or the medial VTA using genetic inducible fate mapping,
                 ultramicroscopy, time-lapse imaging, slice culture and
                 analysis of mouse mutants. We demonstrate that neurons
                 destined for the SN migrate first radially and then
                 tangentially, whereas neurons destined for the medial VTA
                 undergo primarily radial migration. We show that tangentially
                 migrating dopaminergic neurons express the components of the
                 reelin signaling pathway, whereas dopaminergic neurons in
                 their initial, radial migration phase express CXC chemokine
                 receptor 4 (CXCR4), the receptor for the chemokine CXC motif
                 ligand 12 (CXCL12). Perturbation of reelin signaling
                 interferes with the speed and orientation of tangentially, but
                 not radially, migrating dopaminergic neurons and results in
                 severe defects in the formation of the SN. By contrast,
                 CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling modulates the initial migration of
                 dopaminergic neurons. With this study, we provide the first
                 molecular and functional characterization of the distinct
                 migratory pathways taken by dopaminergic neurons destined for
                 SN and VTA, and uncover mechanisms that regulate different
                 migratory behaviors of dopaminergic neurons.",

                 development and function of complex biological systems at high
                 spatiotemporal resolution and over long time scales. Such
                 experiments typically generate terabytes of multidimensional
                 image data, and thus they demand efficient computational
                 solutions for data management, processing and analysis. We
                 present protocols and software to tackle these steps, focusing
                 on the imaging-based study of animal development. Our
                 protocols facilitate (i) high-speed lossless data compression
                 and content-based multiview image fusion optimized for
                 multicore CPU architectures, reducing image data size
                 30-500-fold; (ii) automated large-scale cell tracking and
                 segmentation; and (iii) visualization, editing and annotation
                 of multiterabyte image data and cell-lineage reconstructions
                 with tens of millions of data points. These software modules
                 are open source. They provide high data throughput using a
                 single computer workstation and are readily applicable to a

                 mitigating light scattering in situ. Multi-scale
                 high-resolution imaging requires preservation of tissue
                 integrity for accurate signal reconstruction. However,
                 existing clearing reagents contain chemical components that

                 anatomical and fluorescence signal stability. We developed
                 ScaleS, a sorbitol-based optical clearing method that provides
                 stable tissue preservation for immunochemical labeling and
                 three-dimensional (3D) signal rendering. ScaleS permitted
                 optical reconstructions of aged and diseased brain in
                 Alzheimer's disease models, including mapping of 3D networks
                 of amyloid plaques, neurons and microglia, and multi-scale

  abstract    = "Cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions need to
                 adapt to an unfavorable metabolic microenvironment. As
                 distance from supplying blood vessels increases, oxygen and
                 nutrient concentrations decrease and cancer cells react by
                 stopping cell cycle progression and becoming dormant. As
                 cytostatic drugs mainly target proliferating cells, cancer
                 cell dormancy is considered as a major resistance mechanism to
                 this class of anti-cancer drugs. Therefore, substances that
                 target cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions have
                 the potential to enhance cytostatic-based chemotherapy of
                 solid tumors. With three-dimensional growth conditions,
                 multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) reproduce several
                 parameters of the tumor microenvironment, including oxygen and
                 nutrient gradients as well as the development of dormant tumor
                 regions. We here report the setup of a 3D cell culture
                 compatible high-content screening system and the
                 identification of nine substances from two commercially
                 available drug libraries that specifically target cells in
                 inner MCTS core regions, while cells in outer MCTS regions or
                 in 2D cell culture remain unaffected. We elucidated the mode
                 of action of the identified compounds as inhibitors of the
                 respiratory chain and show that induction of cell death in
                 inner MCTS core regions critically depends on extracellular
                 glucose concentrations. Finally, combinational treatment with
                 cytostatics showed increased induction of cell death in MCTS.
                 The data presented here shows for the first time a
                 high-content based screening setup on 3D tumor spheroids for
                 the identification of substances that specifically induce cell
                 death in inner tumor spheroid core regions. This validates the
                 approach to use 3D cell culture screening systems to identify
                 substances that would not be detectable by 2D based screening

  abstract    = "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a critical gaseous signaling
                 molecule emerging at the center of a rich field of chemical
                 and biological research. As our understanding of the
                 complexity of physiological H2S in signaling pathways evolves,
                 advanced chemical and technological investigative tools are
                 required to make sense of this interconnectivity. Toward this
                 goal, we have developed an azide-functionalized O-methylrhodol
                 fluorophore, MeRho-Az, which exhibits a rapid >1000-fold
                 fluorescence response when treated with H2S, is selective for
                 H2S over other biological analytes, and has a detection limit
                 of 86 nM. Additionally, the MeRho-Az scaffold is less
                 susceptible to photoactivation than other commonly used
                 azide-based systems, increasing its potential application in
                 imaging experiments. To demonstrate the efficacy of this probe
                 for H2S detection, we demonstrate the ability of MeRho-Az to
                 detect differences in H2S levels in C6 cells and those treated
                 with AOAA, a common inhibitor of enzymatic H2S synthesis.
                 Expanding the use of MeRho-Az to complex and heterogeneous

                 Physonects employ multiple, clonal medusan individuals, termed
                 nectophores, to propel an aggregate colony. Here we show that
                 developmental differences between clonal nectophores of the

                 thrust and torque production that controls direction and

                 powerful, the position of young nectophores near the apex of
                 the nectosome allows them to dominate torque production for
                 turning, whereas older, larger and more powerful individuals
                 near the base of the nectosome contribute predominantly to
                 forward thrust production. The patterns we describe offer

                 users to overcome this limitation by restricting excitation to
                 a narrow illumination plane. In addition, light-sheet imaging
                 allows for high-speed image acquisition with uniform
                 illumination of samples composed of multiple cell layers. The

                 platforms with specialized hardware and software, along with
                 specific sample handling approaches. The first versatile

              illumination microscopy",
  author   = "Hedde, Per Niklas and Gratton, Enrico",
  abstract = "Due to its sectioning capability, large field of view, and
              minimal light exposure, selective plane illumination microscopy
              has become the preferred choice for 3D time lapse imaging. Single
              cells in a dish can be conveniently imaged using an
              upright/inverted configuration. However, for measurements on long
              time scales (hours to days), mechanical drift is a problem;
              especially for studies of mammalian cells that typically require
              heating to 37°C which causes a thermal gradient across the
              instrument. Since the light sheet diverges towards the edges of
              the field of view, such a drift leads to a decrease in axial
              resolution over time. Or, even worse, the specimen could move out
              of the imaging volume. Here, we present a simple, cost-effective
              way to stabilize the axial position using the microscope camera
              to track the sample position. Thereby, sample loss is prevented
              and an optimal axial resolution is maintained by keeping the
              sample at the position where the light sheet is at its thinnest.
              We demonstrate the virtue of our approach by measurements of the
              light sheet thickness and 3D time lapse imaging of a cell
              monolayer at physiological conditions.",

                 overcome these problems, here we demonstrate an integrated

  abstract    = "UNLABELLED: The vertebrate intestine is home to microbial
                 ecosystems that play key roles in host development and health.
                 Little is known about the spatial and temporal dynamics of
                 these microbial communities, limiting our understanding of
                 fundamental properties, such as their mechanisms of growth,
                 propagation, and persistence. To address this, we inoculated
                 initially germ-free zebrafish larvae with fluorescently
                 labeled strains of an Aeromonas species, representing an
                 abundant genus in the zebrafish gut. Using light sheet
                 fluorescence microscopy to obtain three-dimensional images
                 spanning the gut, we quantified the entire bacterial load, as
                 founding populations grew from tens to tens of thousands of
                 cells over several hours. The data yield the first ever
                 measurements of the growth kinetics of a microbial species
                 inside a live vertebrate intestine and show dynamics that
                 robustly fit a logistic growth model. Intriguingly, bacteria
                 were nonuniformly distributed throughout the gut, and
                 bacterial aggregates showed considerably higher growth rates
                 than did discrete individuals. The form of aggregate growth
                 indicates intrinsically higher division rates for clustered
                 bacteria, rather than surface-mediated agglomeration onto
                 clusters. Thus, the spatial organization of gut bacteria both
                 relative to the host and to each other impacts overall growth
                 kinetics, suggesting that spatial characterizations will be an
                 important input to predictive models of host-associated
                 microbial community assembly. IMPORTANCE: Our intestines are
                 home to vast numbers of microbes that influence many aspects
                 of health and disease. Though we now know a great deal about
                 the constituents of the gut microbiota, we understand very
                 little about their spatial structure and temporal dynamics in
                 humans or in any animal: how microbial populations establish
                 themselves, grow, fluctuate, and persist. To address this, we
                 made use of a model organism, the zebrafish, and a new optical
                 imaging technique, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, to
                 visualize for the first time the colonization of a live,
                 vertebrate gut by specific bacteria with sufficient resolution
                 to quantify the population over a range from a few individuals
                 to tens of thousands of bacterial cells. Our results provide
                 unprecedented measures of bacterial growth kinetics and also
                 show the influence of spatial structure on bacterial
                 populations, which can be revealed only by direct imaging.",

  abstract    = "Characterizing the cytoarchitecture of mammalian central
                 nervous system on a brain-wide scale is becoming a compelling
                 need in neuroscience. For example, realistic modeling of brain
                 activity requires the definition of quantitative features of
                 large neuronal populations in the whole brain. Quantitative
                 anatomical maps will also be crucial to classify the
                 cytoarchtitectonic abnormalities associated with neuronal
                 pathologies in a high reproducible and reliable manner. In
                 this paper, we apply recent advances in optical microscopy and
                 image analysis to characterize the spatial distribution of
                 Purkinje cells (PCs) across the whole cerebellum. Light sheet
                 microscopy was used to image with micron-scale resolution a
                 fixed and cleared cerebellum of an L7-GFP transgenic mouse, in
                 which all PCs are fluorescently labeled. A fast and scalable
                 algorithm for fully automated cell identification was applied
                 on the image to extract the position of all the fluorescent
                 PCs. This vectorized representation of the cell population
                 allows a thorough characterization of the complex
                 three-dimensional distribution of the neurons, highlighting
                 the presence of gaps inside the lamellar organization of PCs,
                 whose density is believed to play a significant role in autism
                 spectrum disorders. Furthermore, clustering analysis of the
                 localized somata permits dividing the whole cerebellum in
                 groups of PCs with high spatial correlation, suggesting new
                 possibilities of anatomical partition. The quantitative
                 approach presented here can be extended to study the
                 distribution of different types of cell in many brain regions
                 and across the whole encephalon, providing a robust base for
                 building realistic computational models of the brain, and for
                 unbiased morphological tissue screening in presence of
                 pathologies and/or drug treatments.",

                 designed for high acquisition speeds and enables extended
                 time-lapse in vivo experiments when using fluorescently
                 labeled specimens. We demonstrate the capability of the setup
                 to monitor gene expression and protein localization during
                 ageing and upon starvation stress in longitudinal studies in
                 individual or small groups of adult Caenorhabditis elegans
                 nematodes. The system is equipped to readily perform
                 fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), which
                 allows monitoring protein recovery and distribution under low

  abstract    = "In vivo functional imaging at single-neuron resolution is an
                 important approach to visualize biological processes in
                 neuroscience. Light sheet microscopy (LSM) is a cutting edge
                 in vivo imaging technique that provides micron-scale spatial
                 resolution at high frame rate. Due to the scattering and
                 absorption of tissue, however, conventional LSM is inadequate
                 to resolve cells because of the attenuated signal to noise
                 ratio (SNR). Using dual-beam illumination and confocal
                 dual-slit detection, here a dual-slit confocal LSM is
                 demonstrated to obtain the SNR enhanced images with frame rate
                 twice as high as line confocal LSM method. Through theoretical
                 calculations and experiments, the correlation between the
                 slit's width and SNR was determined to optimize the image
                 quality. In vivo whole brain structural imaging stacks and the
                 functional imaging sequences of single slice were obtained for
                 analysis of calcium activities at single-cell resolution. A
                 two-fold increase in imaging speed of conventional confocal
                 LSM makes it possible to capture the sequence of the neurons'
                 activities and help reveal the potential functional
                 connections in the whole zebrafish's brain.",

  abstract    = "Hair cells in the adult mammalian cochlea cannot spontaneously
                 regenerate after damage, resulting in the permanency of
                 hearing loss. Stem cells have been found to be present in the
                 cochlea of young rodents; however, there has been little
                 evidence for their existence into adulthood. We used
                 nestin-CreER(T2)/tdTomato-reporter mice to trace the lineage
                 of putative nestin-expressing cells and their progeny in the
                 cochleae of adult mice. Nestin, an intermediate filament found
                 in neural progenitor cells during early development and
                 adulthood, is regarded as a multipotent and neural stem cell
                 marker. Other investigators have reported its presence in
                 postnatal and young adult rodents; however, there are
                 discrepancies among these reports. Using lineage tracing, we
                 documented a robust population of tdTomato-expressing cells
                 and evaluated these cells at a series of adult time points.
                 Upon activation of the nestin promoter, tdTomato was observed
                 just below and medial to the inner hair cell layer. All cells
                 colocalized with the stem cell and cochlear-supporting-cell
                 marker Sox2 as well as the supporting cell and Schwann cell
                 marker Sox10; however, they did not colocalize with the
                 Schwann cell marker Krox20, spiral ganglion marker NF200, nor
                 glial fibrillary acidic acid (GFAP)-expressing supporting cell
                 marker. The cellular identity of this unique population of
                 tdTomato-expressing cells in the adult cochlea of
                 nestin-CreER(T2)/tdTomato mice remains unclear; however, these
                 cells may represent a type of supporting cell on the neural
                 aspect of the inner hair cell layer.",

                 essential to understand fundamental three-dimensional (3D)
                 biological processes such as tissue development and cancer.
                 Analysis of 3D in vivo images, however, is very challenging.
                 Today's best practice, manual annotation of select image

                 which are unsuitable for reliable mechanistic inferences.
                 Here, we present an integrated workflow for quantitative in
                 vivo cell-cycle profiling. It combines image analysis and
                 machine learning methods for automated 3D segmentation and

  abstract    = "Light-sheet microscopy is an increasingly popular technique in
                 the life sciences due to its fast 3D imaging capability of
                 fluorescent samples with low photo toxicity compared to
                 confocal methods. In this work we present a new, fast,
                 flexible and simple to implement method to optimize the
                 illumination light-sheet to the requirement at hand. A
                 telescope composed of two electrically tuneable lenses enables
                 us to define thickness and position of the light-sheet
                 independently but accurately within milliseconds, and
                 therefore optimize image quality of the features of interest
                 interactively. We demonstrated the practical benefit of this
                 technique by 1) assembling large field of views from tiled
                 single exposure each with individually optimized illumination
                 settings; 2) sculpting the light-sheet to trace complex sample
                 shapes within single exposures. This technique proved
                 compatible with confocal line scanning detection, further
                 improving image contrast and resolution. Finally, we
                 determined the effect of light-sheet optimization in the
                 context of scattering tissue, devising procedures for

               This limits the study of flow in more intricate biological

               datasets related via a rigid-body transform and degraded by an
               anisotropic point-spread-function (PSF). Registration is
               necessary, for example, when fusing data in multi-view
               microscopy. Automatic algorithms that only rely on maximizing
               pixel similarity, without accounting for the anisotropic image

               propose to solve this problem by re-blurring the reference and
               test data with transformed forms of the PSF, in order to make
               them comparable, before minimizing the mean squared intensity

               sub-pixel registration algorithm proposed by Thévenaz et al.,

                 fluorescently-tagged proteins in live cells with a precision
                 well below that of the diffraction limit. Here, we demonstrate
                 3D sectioning with single-molecule super-resolution microscopy
                 by making use of the fitting information that is usually
                 discarded to reject fluorophores that emit from above or below
                 a virtual-'light-sheet', a thin volume centred on the focal
                 plane of the microscope. We describe an easy-to-use routine
                 (implemented as an open-source ImageJ plug-in) to quickly
                 analyse a calibration sample to define and use such a virtual
                 light-sheet. In addition, the plug-in is easily usable on
                 almost any existing 2D super-resolution instrumentation. This
                 optical sectioning of super-resolution images is achieved by
                 applying well-characterised width and amplitude thresholds to
                 diffraction-limited spots that can be used to tune the
                 thickness of the virtual light-sheet. This allows qualitative
                 and quantitative imaging improvements: by rejecting
                 out-of-focus fluorophores, the super-resolution image gains
                 contrast and local features may be revealed; by retaining only
                 fluorophores close to the focal plane, virtual-'light-sheet'

                 meet the increasing demand of growing tissues for oxygen and
                 nutrients. This is achieved by the pruning of redundant blood
                 vessel segments, which then allows more efficient blood flow
                 patterns. Because of the lack of an in vivo system suitable
                 for high-resolution live imaging, the dynamics of the pruning
                 process have not been described in detail. Here, we present
                 the subintestinal vein (SIV) plexus of the zebrafish embryo as
                 a novel model to study pruning at the cellular level. We show
                 that blood vessel regression is a coordinated process of cell
                 rearrangements involving lumen collapse and cell-cell contact
                 resolution. Interestingly, the cellular rearrangements during
                 pruning resemble endothelial cell behavior during vessel
                 fusion in a reversed order. In pruning segments, endothelial
                 cells first migrate toward opposing sides where they join the
                 parental vascular branches, thus remodeling the multicellular
                 segment into a unicellular connection. Often, the lumen is
                 maintained throughout this process, and transient unicellular
                 tubes form through cell self-fusion. In a second step, the
                 unicellular connection is resolved unilaterally, and the
                 pruning cell rejoins the opposing branch. Thus, we show for
                 the first time that various cellular activities are
                 coordinated to achieve blood vessel pruning and define two
                 different morphogenetic pathways, which are selected by the

                 pericycle cells located deep within the parental root and have
                 to emerge through endodermal, cortical, and epidermal tissues.
                 These overlaying tissues place biomechanical constraints on
                 the LRPs that are likely to impact their morphogenesis. This
                 study probes the interplay between the patterns of cell
                 division, organ shape, and overlaying tissues on LRP
                 morphogenesis by exploiting recent advances in live plant cell
                 imaging and image analysis. Our 3D/4D image analysis revealed
                 that early stage LRPs exhibit tangential divisions that create
                 a ring of cells corralling a population of rapidly dividing
                 cells at its center. The patterns of division in the latter
                 population of cells during LRP morphogenesis are not
                 stereotypical. In contrast, statistical analysis demonstrated
                 that the shape of new LRPs is highly conserved. We tested the
                 relative importance of cell division pattern versus overlaying
                 tissues on LRP morphogenesis using mutant and transgenic
                 approaches. The double mutant aurora1 (aur1) aur2 disrupts the
                 pattern of LRP cell divisions and impacts its growth dynamics,
                 yet the new organ's dome shape remains normal. In contrast,
                 manipulating the properties of overlaying tissues disrupted
                 LRP morphogenesis. We conclude that the interaction with
                 overlaying tissues, rather than the precise pattern of
                 divisions, is most important for LRP morphogenesis and
                 optimizes the process of lateral root emergence.",

               its ability to acquire 3D images with high 3D spatial
               resolution, good optical sectioning capability and high imaging
               speed. However, tradeoffs have to be made when a large field of
               view (FOV) is required, results in lower axial resolution or
               worse optical sectioning capability. Here, we present a novel
               method for 3D imaging by SPIM that is capable to maintain its
               high 3D spatial resolution and good optical sectioning
               capability within a large FOV. Instead of trying to generate a
               large and uniformly thick excitation light sheet, the method
               tiles a relative small light sheet quickly to multiple positions
               within the image plane by defocusing the excitation beam used to
               create the light sheet, and takes one additional image at each
               position, so that a large FOV can be imaged by repeating this
               process and stitching all images together. By implementing this
               method, light sheets with thin thickness and good excitation
               light confinement can be used for SPIM imaging with slightly
               compromised imaging speed. The method was investigated through

                 recent advances in the quantitative imaging of all-cell
                 morphogenesis in living organisms. Here we have developed a
                 light-sheet fluorescence microscopy-based framework with
                 single-cell resolution for identification and characterization
                 of subtle phenotypical changes of millimeter-sized organisms.
                 Such a comparative study requires analyses of entire ensembles
                 to be able to distinguish sample-to-sample variations from
                 definitive phenotypical changes. We present a kinetic digital
                 model of zebrafish embryos up to 16 h of development. The
                 model is based on the precise overlay and averaging of data
                 taken on multiple individuals and describes the cell density
                 and its migration direction at every point in time.
                 Quantitative metrics for multi-sample comparative studies have
                 been introduced to analyze developmental variations within the
                 ensemble. The digital model may serve as a canvas on which the
                 behavior of cellular subpopulations can be studied. As an
                 example, we have investigated cellular rearrangements during
                 germ layer formation at the onset of gastrulation. A
                 comparison of the one-eyed pinhead (oep) mutant with the
                 digital model of the wild-type embryo reveals its abnormal
                 development at the onset of gastrulation, many hours before
                 changes are obvious to the eye.",

                 spatial resolution, good optical sectioning capability and
                 minimal photobleaching and phototoxic effect. SPIM gains its
                 advantage by confining the excitation light near the detection
                 focal plane, and its performance is determined by the ability
                 to create a thin, large and uniform excitation light sheet.
                 Several methods have been developed to create such an
                 excitation light sheet for SPIM. However, each method has its
                 own strengths and weaknesses, and tradeoffs must be made among
                 different aspects in SPIM imaging. In this work, we present a
                 strategy to select the excitation light sheet among the latest

                 confocal and two-photon microscopy have revolutionized
                 biomedical research, current implementations are costly,
                 complex and limited in their ability to image 3D volumes at
                 high speeds. Light-sheet microscopy techniques using
                 two-objective, orthogonal illumination and detection require a
                 highly constrained sample geometry, and either physical sample
                 translation or complex synchronization of illumination and
                 detection planes. In contrast, SCAPE microscopy acquires
                 images using an angled, swept light-sheet in a
                 single-objective, en-face geometry. Unique confocal descanning

                 translationless 3D imaging of intact samples at rates
                 exceeding 20 volumes per second. We demonstrate SCAPE
                 microscopy by imaging spontaneous neuronal firing in the

               ability to optically section fluorescent samples in the axial
               dimension, perpendicular to the image plane. These approaches,
               via the placement of a pinhole in the conjugate image plane,
               provided superior resolution in the axial (z) dimension
               resulting in nearly isotropic optical sections. However,
               increased axial resolution, via pinhole optics, comes at the
               cost of both speed and excitation efficiency. Light sheet
               fluorescent microscopy (LSFM), a century-old idea made possible
               with modern developments in both excitation and detection
               optics, provides sub-cellular resolution and optical sectioning
               capabilities without compromising speed or excitation
               efficiency. Over the past decade, several variations of LSFM
               have been implemented each with its own benefits and
               deficiencies. Here we discuss LSFM fundamentals and outline the

               inclusions in bulk high-purity materials for fiber and power
               optics. In this technique, the concentration and size of
               inclusions undetectable by optical microscopy are determined
               using CCD detection of the light scattered by them in a
               direction normal to the incident laser beam at wavelengths from
               0.63 to 0.98 $\mu$m. The detection limit of the technique in
               terms of inclusion size is n \texttimes{} (10--100) nm, the
               range of detectable number concentrations is 1--1011 cm−3, and
               the scan depth in the sample is ∼1 cm. Its performance has been
               evaluated using test systems. The potential of the technique is
               illustrated by the dispersion analysis of promising materials

  abstract    = "As commercial space flights have become feasible and long-term
                 extraterrestrial missions are planned, it is imperative that
                 the impact of space travel and the space environment on human
                 physiology be thoroughly characterized. Scrutinizing the
                 effects of potentially detrimental factors such as ionizing
                 radiation and microgravity at the cellular and tissue level
                 demands adequate visualization technology. Advanced light
                 microscopy (ALM) is the leading tool for non-destructive
                 structural and functional investigation of static as well as
                 dynamic biological systems. In recent years, technological
                 developments and advances in photochemistry and genetic
                 engineering have boosted all aspects of resolution, readout
                 and throughput, rendering ALM ideally suited for biological
                 space research. While various microscopy-based studies have
                 addressed cellular response to space-related environmental
                 stressors, biological endpoints have typically been determined
                 only after the mission, leaving an experimental gap that is
                 prone to bias results. An on-board, real-time microscopical
                 monitoring device can bridge this gap. Breadboards and even
                 fully operational microscope setups have been conceived, but
                 they need to be rendered more compact and versatile. Most
                 importantly, they must allow addressing the impact of gravity,
                 or the lack thereof, on physiologically relevant biological
                 systems in space and in ground-based simulations. In order to
                 delineate the essential functionalities for such a system, we
                 have reviewed the pending questions in space science, the
                 relevant biological model systems, and the state-of-the art in
                 ALM. Based on a rigorous trade-off, in which we recognize the
                 relevance of multi-cellular systems and the cellular
                 microenvironment, we propose a compact, but flexible concept
                 for space-related cell biological research that is based on

                 sample in a plane and captures single-photon-excitation
                 fluorescence images with a camera from a direction
                 perpendicular to the light sheet. This method is potentially
                 useful for observing biological specimens, because image
                 acquisition is relatively fast, resulting in reduction of
                 phototoxicity. However, DSLM cannot be effectively applied to
                 high-scattering materials due to the image blur resulting from
                 thickening of the light sheet by scattered photons. However,
                 two-photon-excitation DSLM (2p-DSLM) enables collection of
                 high-contrast image with near infrared (NIR) excitation. In
                 conventional 2p-DSLM, the minimal excitation volume for
                 two-photon excitation restricts the field of view. In this
                 study, we achieved wide-field 2p-DSLM by using a high-pulse
                 energy fiber laser, and then used this technique to perform
                 intravital imaging of a small model fish species, medaka

                 and high-peak energy NIR excitation at 1040 nm. We also
                 performed high-speed imaging at near-video rate and

                 medaka fish at 20 frames/sec.",

                 the sequence of epithelial tissue invaginations constituting
                 the process of gastrulation. By combining recent advancements
                 in light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) and image
                 processing, the three-dimensional fly embryo morphology and
                 relevant gene expression patterns can be accurately recorded
                 throughout the entire process of embryogenesis. LSFM provides
                 exceptionally high imaging speed, high signal-to-noise ratio,
                 low level of photoinduced damage, and good optical penetration
                 depth. This powerful combination of capabilities makes LSFM
                 particularly suitable for live imaging of the fly embryo.The
                 resulting high-information-content image data are subsequently
                 processed to obtain the outlines of cells and cell nuclei, as
                 well as the geometry of the whole embryo tissue by image
                 segmentation. Furthermore, morphodynamics information is
                 extracted by computationally tracking objects in the image.
                 Towards that goal we describe the successful implementation of
                 a fast fitting strategy of Gaussian mixture models.The data
                 obtained by image processing is well-suited for hypothesis
                 testing of the detailed biomechanics of the gastrulating
                 embryo. Typically this involves constructing computational
                 mechanics models that consist of an objective function
                 providing an estimate of strain energy for a given
                 morphological configuration of the tissue, and a numerical
                 minimization mechanism of this energy, achieved by varying
                 morphological parameters.In this chapter, we provide an
                 overview of in vivo imaging of fruit fly embryos using LSFM,
                 computational tools suitable for processing the resulting

                 century, with one key issue being the emergence of the
                 notochord. In vertebrates, the notochord develops by
                 convergence and extension of the chordamesoderm, a population
                 of midline cells of unique molecular identity. We identify a

                 the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, that converges and

                 combination of genes. These cells differentiate into a

                 central nervous system and axial blood vessel and secretes a

                 heavily dependent on identification of novel pathways or
                 regulators. Although genome-wide techniques such as RNA
                 sequencing are ideally suited for discovering novel candidate
                 genes, they are unable to yield spatially resolved information
                 in embryos or tissues. Microscopy-based approaches, using in
                 situ hybridization, for example, can provide spatial
                 information about gene expression, but are limited to
                 analyzing one or a few genes at a time. Here, we present a
                 method where we combine traditional histological techniques
                 with low-input RNA sequencing and mathematical image
                 reconstruction to generate a high-resolution genome-wide 3D

                 offer several advantages over other fluorescence microscopy
                 methods for live, 3D microscopy. These systems are valuable
                 for studying embryonic development in several animal systems,
                 such as Drosophila, C. elegans and zebrafish. The geometry of
                 the light path in this form of microscopy requires the sample
                 to be accessible from multiple sides and fixed in place so
                 that it can be rotated around a single axis. Popular methods
                 for mounting include hanging the specimen from a pin or
                 embedding it in 1-2\% agarose. These methods can be
                 particularly problematic for certain samples, such as
                 post-implantation mouse embryos, that expand significantly in
                 size and are very delicate and sensitive to mounting. To
                 overcome the current limitations and to establish a robust
                 strategy for long-term (24 h) time-lapse imaging of E6.5-8.5
                 mouse embryos with light-sheet microscopy, we developed and
                 tested a method using hollow agarose cylinders designed to
                 accommodate for embryonic growth, yet provide boundaries to
                 minimize tissue drift and enable imaging in multiple
                 orientations. Here, we report the first 24-h time-lapse
                 sequences of post-implantation mouse embryo development with
                 light-sheet microscopy. We demonstrate that light-sheet
                 imaging can provide both quantitative data for tracking
                 changes in morphogenesis and reveal new insights into mouse
                 embryogenesis. Although we have used this approach for imaging
                 mouse embryos, it can be extended to imaging other types of
                 embryos as well as tissue explants.",

  abstract = "We present a new method for quantifying the feeding of individual
              copepods, using a planar sheet of laser light to stimulate the
              fluorescence of phytoplankton ingested by the copepod. The
              fluorescence is imaged with a sensitive CCD camera, giving
              two-dimensional images of the copepod's gut with 20 \texttimes{}
              20 µm spatial resolution. Using tethered copepods, we have
              obtained > 3 h long time series of copepod gut fluorescence with
              images every 15--20 s. The same individual copepod can be used
              for multiple experiments, obviating the problems of individual
              variability as a source of error. Initial data reveal two
              distinct patterns of variability as material moves through two
              functionally different gut compartments. These patterns reflect
              processes occurring in each compartment. The upper (anterior)
              mid-gut shows higher variability and less repeatability than the
              posterior midgut where undigested material is aggregated into a
              fecal pellet and evacuated at regular intervals. Variability in
              the upper mid-gut is likely due to factors such as intermittence
              of feeding and relatively complex mixing dynamics. In the
              posterior mid-gut, mixing dynamics are much simpler, and the
              variability of the upper compartment is integrated over the time
              scale of pellet formation.",

               a system based on a light sheet fluorescence microscope (LSFM),
               which is optimized for long-term, multi-position imaging of
               three-dimensional in-gel cell cultures. The system integrates a
               stable culture condition control system in the optical path of
               the light-sheet microscope. A further essential element is a
               biocompatible agarose container suitable for the LSFM, in which
               any cell type can be cultured in different gel matrices. The
               TC-LSFM allows studying any in vitro cultured cell type reacting
               to, dividing in, or migrating through a three-dimensional
               extracellular matrix (ECM) gel. For this reason we called it
               ``tissue culture-LSFM'' (TC-LSFM). The TC-LSFM system allows
               fast imaging at multiple locations within a millimeter-sized ECM
               gel. This increases the number of analyzed events and allows
               testing population effects. As an example, we show the
               maturation of a cyst of MDCK (canine kidney epithelial) cells
               over a period of three days. Moreover, we imaged, tracked, and
               analyzed MDCK cells during the first five days of cell aggregate
               formation and discovered a remarkable heterogeneity in cell
               cycle lengths and an interesting cell death pattern. Thus,
               TC-LSFM allows performing new long-term assays assessing
               cellular behavior in three-dimensional ECM-gel cultures. For
               example migration, invasion or differentiation in epithelial

                 microscopy (SPIM) is described which is easily adapted to an
                 inverted wide-field microscope and optimized for 3-dimensional
                 cell cultures, e.g., multi-cellular tumor spheroids (MCTS).
                 The SPIM excitation module shapes and deflects the light such
                 that the sample is illuminated by a light sheet perpendicular
                 to the detection path of the microscope. The system is
                 characterized by use of a rectangular capillary for holding
                 (and in an advanced version also by a micro-capillary approach
                 for rotating) the samples, by synchronous adjustment of the
                 illuminating light sheet and the objective lens used for
                 fluorescence detection as well as by adaptation of a
                 microfluidic system for application of fluorescent dyes,
                 pharmaceutical agents or drugs in small quantities. A protocol
                 for working with this system is given, and some technical
                 details are reported. Representative results include (1)
                 measurements of the uptake of a cytostatic drug (doxorubicin)
                 and its partial conversion to a degradation product, (2) redox
                 measurements by use of a genetically encoded glutathione
                 sensor upon addition of an oxidizing agent, and (3) initiation

  abstract = "BACKGROUND:Heterochromatin in the nucleus of human embryonic
              cells plays an important role in the epigenetic regulation of
              gene expression. The architecture of heterochromatin and its
              dynamic organization remain elusive because of the lack of fast
              and high-resolution deep-cell imaging tools. We enable this task
              by advancing instrumental and algorithmic implementation of the
              localization-based super-resolution technique.RESULTS:We present
              light-sheet Bayesian super-resolution microscopy (LSBM). We adapt
              light-sheet illumination for super-resolution imaging by using a
              novel prism-coupled condenser design to illuminate a thin slice
              of the nucleus with high signal-to-noise ratio. Coupled with a
              Bayesian algorithm that resolves overlapping fluorophores from
              high-density areas, we show, for the first time, nanoscopic
              features of the heterochromatin structure in both fixed and live
              human embryonic stem cells. The enhanced temporal resolution
              allows capturing the dynamic change of heterochromatin with a
              lateral resolution of 50-60 nm on a time scale of 2.3
              s.CONCLUSION:Light-sheet Bayesian microscopy opens up broad new
              possibilities of probing nanometer-scale nuclear structures and
              real-time sub-cellular processes and other previously
              difficult-to-access intracellular regions of living cells at the

                 in the excitation arm of a SPIM system, we successfully

                 barrier (BBB), which allows delivery of large molecules to
                 brain tumors. However, achieving optimal drug concentrations
                 in brain tumors remains a significant hurdle for treating
                 patients successfully. Thus, detailed investigations of drug
                 activities in gliomas are needed. To investigate BBB
                 penetration, pharmacodynamics, and tumor retention kinetics of
                 an agonistic DR5 antibody in a brain tumor xenograft model, we
                 utilized a noninvasive imaging method for longitudinal
                 monitoring of apoptosis induction. Brain tumors were induced
                 by intracranial (i.c.) implantation of a luciferase-expressing
                 tumor cell line as a reporter. To quantify accumulation of
                 anti-DR5 in brain tumors, we generated a dosage-response curve
                 for apoptosis induction after i.c. delivery of
                 fluorescence-labeled anti-DR5 at different dosages. Assuming
                 100\% drug delivery after i.c. application, the amount of
                 accumulated antibody after i.v. application was calculated
                 relative to its apoptosis induction. We found that up to
                 0.20\% to 0.97\% of antibody delivered i.v. reached the brain
                 tumor, but that apoptosis induction declined quickly within 24
                 hours. These results were confirmed by three-dimensional
                 fluorescence microscopy of antibody accumulation in explanted
                 brains. Nonetheless, significant antitumor efficacy was
                 documented after anti-DR5 delivery. We further demonstrated
                 that antibody penetration was facilitated by an impaired BBB
                 in brain tumors. These imaging methods enable the
                 quantification of antibody accumulation and pharmacodynamics

                 tomography (micro-CT) has emerged as a valuable imaging tool
                 to noninvasively obtain quantitative physiological biomarkers
                 of drug effect in preclinical studies of antiangiogenic
                 compounds. In this study, we explored the ability of DCE
                 micro-CT to assess the antiangiogenic treatment response in
                 breast cancer xenografts and correlated the results to the
                 structural vessel response obtained from 3-dimensional (3D)
                 fluorescence ultramicroscopy (UM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two
                 groups of tumor-bearing mice (KPL-4) underwent DCE micro-CT
                 imaging using a fast preclinical dual-source micro-CT system
                 (TomoScope Synergy Twin, CT Imaging GmbH, Erlangen, Germany).
                 Mice were treated with either a monoclonal antibody against
                 the vascular endothelial growth factor or an unspecific
                 control antibody. Changes in vascular physiology were assessed
                 measuring the mean value of the relative blood volume (rBV)
                 and the permeability-surface area product (PS) in different
                 tumor regions of interest (tumor center, tumor periphery, and
                 total tumor tissue). Parametric maps of rBV were calculated of
                 the tumor volume to assess the intratumoral vascular
                 heterogeneity. Isotropic 3D UM vessel scans were performed
                 from excised tumor tissue, and automated 3D segmentation
                 algorithms were used to determine the microvessel density
                 (MVD), relative vessel volume, and vessel diameters. In
                 addition, the accumulation of coinjected fluorescence-labeled
                 trastuzumab was quantified in the UM tissue scans to obtain an
                 indirect measure of vessel permeability. Results of the DCE
                 micro-CT were compared with corresponding results obtained by
                 ex vivo UM. For validation, DCE micro-CT and UM parameters
                 were compared with conventional histology and tumor volume.
                 RESULTS: Examination of the parametric rBV maps revealed
                 significantly different patterns of intratumoral blood supply
                 between treated and control tumors. Whereas control tumors
                 showed a characteristic vascular rim pattern with considerably
                 elevated rBV values in the tumor periphery, treated tumors
                 showed a widely homogeneous blood supply. Compared with UM,
                 the physiological rBV maps showed excellent agreement with the
                 spatial morphology of the intratumoral vascular architecture.
                 Regional assessment of mean physiological values exhibited a
                 significant decrease in rBV (P < 0.01) and PS (P < 0.05) in
                 the tumor periphery after anti-vascular endothelial growth
                 factor treatment. Structural validation with UM showed a
                 significant reduction in reduction of relative vessel volume
                 (rVV) (P < 0.01) and MVD (P < 0.01) in the corresponding tumor
                 region. The reduction in rBV correlated well with the rVV (R =
                 0.73 for single values and R = 0.95 for mean values). Spatial
                 maps of antibody penetration showed a significantly reduced
                 antibody accumulation (P < 0.01) in the tumor tissue after
                 treatment and agreed well with the physiological change of PS.
                 Examination of vessel diameters revealed a size-dependent
                 antiangiogenic treatment effect, which showed a significant
                 reduction in MVD (P < 0.001) for vessels with diameters
                 smaller than 25 $\mu$m. No treatment effect was observed by
                 tumor volume. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive DCE micro-CT provides
                 valuable physiological information of antiangiogenic drug
                 effect in the intact animal and correlates with ex vivo
                 structural analysis of 3D UM. The combined use of DCE micro-CT
                 with UM constitutes a complementary imaging toolset that can
                 help to enhance our understanding of antiangiogenic drug
                 mechanisms of action in preclinical drug research.",

                 in the brain will require the development of whole-brain

                 comprehensive chemical screening to develop a whole-brain
                 clearing and imaging method, termed CUBIC (clear, unobstructed

                 determination has been widely applied to cellular imaging in
                 recent years. However, quantitative imaging of the mammalian
                 nucleus has been challenging due to the lack of 3D optical
                 sectioning methods for normal-sized cells, as well as the
                 inability to accurately count the absolute copy numbers of
                 biomolecules in highly dense structures. Here we report a
                 reflected light-sheet superresolution microscopy method
                 capable of imaging inside the mammalian nucleus with superior
                 signal-to-background ratio as well as molecular counting with
                 single-copy accuracy. Using reflected light-sheet
                 superresolution microscopy, we probed the spatial organization
                 of transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) molecules and
                 quantified their global extent of clustering inside the
                 mammalian nucleus. Spatiotemporal clustering analysis that
                 leverages on the blinking photophysics of specific organic
                 dyes showed that the majority (>70\%) of the transcription
                 foci originate from single RNAP II molecules, and no
                 significant clustering between RNAP II molecules was detected
                 within the length scale of the reported diameter of
                 ``transcription factories.'' Colocalization measurements of
                 RNAP II molecules equally labeled by two spectrally distinct
                 dyes confirmed the primarily unclustered distribution, arguing
                 against a prevalent existence of transcription factories in
                 the mammalian nucleus as previously proposed. The methods

                 lead to a huge drop in the fluorescence signal, limiting their
                 practical applicability. The reduction of signal to background
                 ratio is commonly ascribed to chemical degradation of the
                 fluorophores by the organic solvents used for clearing. This
                 view however completely neglects another important factor of
                 contrast loss, i.e., optical aberrations. In fact,
                 commercially available objectives suitable for light sheet
                 microscopy are not designed for the refractive index of the
                 clearing solutions, and this mismatch introduces severe
                 spherical aberration. Here we simulated the aberrated point
                 spread function (PSF) of a light sheet microscope with
                 confocal slit detection. We investigated the variation of the
                 PSF as a function of objective numerical aperture (NA) and of
                 imaging depth inside the clearing solution. We also explored
                 the possibility of correcting such spherical aberration by
                 introducing extra optical devices in the detection path. By
                 correcting up to the second order spherical aberration, a
                 quasi-diffraction-limited regime can be recovered, and image
                 quality is restored.",

  abstract  = "Neurons in the olfactory system display extraordinary functional
               diversity, which at the level of sensory neurons arises from the
               expression of one out of several hundred distinct receptor
               types. To cope with this diversity, one approach is to use
               techniques that can record sensory responses from many neurons
               simultaneously. We have developed a form of light-sheet
               microscopy, called objective-coupled planar illumination (OCPI)
               microscopy, that is well suited to recording at high
               signal-to-noise ratios from large neuronal populations. Because
               OCPI microscopy illuminates the entire field simultaneously, it
               allows fast imaging without compromising field of view. At
               current camera speeds, pixels can be acquired more than 100-fold
               faster than by point-scanning fluorescence microscopy. Here we
               describe the theory, advantages, and practical implementation of
               planar illumination and briefly discuss its application to
               neuronal recording in the mouse vomeronasal organ. We also
               provide a brief protocol, in which a mouse is pretreated with
               dye for 1 wk to allow labeling of the sensory neurons before

               microscopy over other super-resolution methods is that images
               can be acquired in real-time without any post-processing.
               However imaging speed and photodamage are two major concerns for
               STED imaging of whole cells. Here we propose a new microscopy
               method we have termed Bessel-Beam STED (or BB-STED) that
               overcomes both of these limitations of conventional STED
               microscopy. In the proposed method, rather than exciting a
               single STED spot in the sample, an entire line of the sample is
               illuminated. This line-scanning technique dramatically increases
               the speed of STED. In addition, plane-illumination by scanning
               of the line across the focal plane of a detection objective
               limits the light to a thin layer of the sample and thus
               significantly reduces photobleaching and photodamage above and
               below the focal plane compared to epi-illumination. Using the
               organic dye Atto647N as an example, we calculated the STED power

                 have been proposed to underlie the emergence of LECs from the

                 information has been obtained by analyzing a single species,
                 the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Embryonic development
                 of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum differs
                 fundamentally from that of Drosophila in aspects such as
                 short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive
                 extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head
                 development. Although Tribolium has become the second most
                 important insect model organism, previous live imaging
                 attempts have addressed only specific questions and no
                 long-term live imaging data of Tribolium embryogenesis have
                 been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence
                 microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete,
                 continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of
                 Tribolium embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The
                 embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process,
                 developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data
                 document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of
                 the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular
                 movement in the same embryo and in four orientations,
                 contributing significantly to the understanding of Tribolium
                 development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive
                 chronological table of Tribolium embryogenesis, integrating
                 most previous work and providing a reference for future
                 studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that
                 serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by
                 more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging

                 determinant of the energetics of cellular membrane
                 deformation. Measurements of membrane bending moduli remain
                 rare, however, and show a large variance, a situation that can
                 be addressed by the development of improved techniques and by
                 comparisons between disparate techniques applied to the same
                 systems. We introduce here the use of selective plane
                 illumination microscopy (SPIM, also known as light sheet
                 fluorescence microscopy) to image thermal fluctuations of
                 giant vesicles. The optical sectioning of SPIM enables
                 high-speed fluorescence imaging of freely suspended vesicles
                 and quantification of edge localization precision, yielding
                 robust fluctuation spectra and rigidity estimates. For both
                 lipid-only membranes and membranes bound by the intracellular
                 trafficking protein Sar1p, which lowers membrane rigidity in a
                 concentration-dependent manner, we show that the resulting
                 bending modulus values are in close agreement with those
                 derived from an independent assay based on membrane tether
                 pulling. We also show that the fluctuation spectra of vesicles
                 bound by the mammalian Sar1A protein, which stiffens membranes
                 at high concentrations, are not well fit by a model of
                 homogeneous quasi-spherical vesicles, suggesting that
                 SPIM-based analysis can offer insights into spatially

                 for 3D + time studies of live embryos in developmental
                 biology. The sample is imaged from several points of view,
                 acquiring a set of 3D views that are then combined or fused in
                 order to overcome their individual limitations. Views fusion
                 is still an open problem despite recent contributions in the
                 field. RESULTS: We developed a wavelet-based multi-view fusion
                 method that, due to wavelet decomposition properties, is able
                 to combine the complementary directional information from all
                 available views into a single volume. Our method is
                 demonstrated on LSFM acquisitions from live sea urchin and
                 zebrafish embryos. The fusion results show improved overall
                 contrast and details when compared with any of the acquired
                 volumes. The proposed method does not need knowledge of the
                 system's point spread function (PSF) and performs better than
                 other existing PSF independent fusion methods. AVAILABILITY

  abstract    = "Elucidating the neural pathways that underlie brain function
                 is one of the greatest challenges in neuroscience. Light sheet
                 based microscopy is a cutting edge method to map cerebral
                 circuitry through optical sectioning of cleared mouse brains.
                 However, the image contrast provided by this method is not
                 sufficient to resolve and reconstruct the entire neuronal
                 network. Here we combined the advantages of light sheet
                 illumination and confocal slit detection to increase the image
                 contrast in real time, with a frame rate of 10 Hz. In fact, in
                 confocal light sheet microscopy (CLSM), the out-of-focus and
                 scattered light is filtered out before detection, without
                 multiple acquisitions or any post-processing of the acquired
                 data. The background rejection capabilities of CLSM were
                 validated in cleared mouse brains by comparison with a
                 structured illumination approach. We show that CLSM allows
                 reconstructing macroscopic brain volumes with sub-cellular
                 resolution. We obtained a comprehensive map of Purkinje cells
                 in the cerebellum of L7-GFP transgenic mice. Further, we were
                 able to trace neuronal projections across brain of thy1-GFP-M
                 transgenic mice. The whole-brain high-resolution fluorescence
                 imaging assured by CLSM may represent a powerful tool to
                 navigate the brain through neuronal pathways. Although this
                 work is focused on brain imaging, the macro-scale
                 high-resolution tomographies affordable with CLSM are ideally
                 suited to explore, at micron-scale resolution, the anatomy of
                 different specimens like murine organs, embryos or flies.",

  abstract    = "The Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is a powerful model for
                 studying neural development, but conventional imaging methods
                 are either too slow or phototoxic to take full advantage of
                 this system. To solve these problems, we developed an inverted
                 selective plane illumination microscopy (iSPIM) module for
                 noninvasive high-speed volumetric imaging of living samples.
                 iSPIM is designed as a straightforward add-on to an inverted
                 microscope, permitting conventional mounting of specimens and
                 facilitating SPIM use by development and neurobiology
                 laboratories. iSPIM offers a volumetric imaging rate
                 30\texttimes{} faster than currently used technologies, such
                 as spinning-disk confocal microscopy, at comparable
                 signal-to-noise ratio. This increased imaging speed allows us
                 to continuously monitor the development of C, elegans embryos,
                 scanning volumes every 2 s for the 14-h period of
                 embryogenesis with no detectable phototoxicity. Collecting
                 ∼25,000 volumes over the entirety of embryogenesis enabled in
                 toto visualization of positions and identities of cell nuclei.
                 By merging two-color iSPIM with automated lineaging techniques
                 we realized two goals: (i) identification of neurons
                 expressing the transcription factor CEH-10/Chx10 and (ii)
                 visualization of their neurodevelopmental dynamics. We found
                 that canal-associated neurons use somal translocation and
                 amoeboid movement as they migrate to their final position in
                 the embryo. We also visualized axon guidance and growth cone
                 dynamics as neurons circumnavigate the nerve ring and reach
                 their targets in the embryo. The high-speed volumetric imaging
                 rate of iSPIM effectively eliminates motion blur from embryo
                 movement inside the egg case, allowing characterization of
                 dynamic neurodevelopmental events that were previously

                 plane-illumination microscopy limits excitation to the

                 resolution. This method is well suited for imaging deep within

                 tissues are exposed to only a thin plane of light, specimen
                 photobleaching and phototoxicity are minimized compared to
                 wide-field fluorescence, confocal, or multiphoton microscopy.

                 increasing interest for cancer and cell biology studies. They
                 allow considering cellular interactions in exploring cell
                 cycle and cell division mechanisms. However, 3D imaging of
                 cell division in living spheroids is technically challenging
                 and has never been reported. RESULTS: Here, we report a major
                 breakthrough based on the engineering of multicellular tumor
                 spheroids expressing an histone H2B fluorescent nuclear
                 reporter protein, and specifically designed sample holders to
                 monitor live cell division dynamics in 3D large spheroids
                 using an home-made selective-plane illumination microscope.
                 CONCLUSIONS: As illustrated using the antimitotic drug,
                 paclitaxel, this technological advance paves the way for
                 studies of the dynamics of cell divion processes in 3D and

                 microscopes with multiple-view imaging, which is used in
                 optical tomography. In contrast to conventional wide-field and
                 confocal fluorescence microscopes, a light sheet illuminates
                 only the focal plane of the detection objective lens from the
                 side. Excitation is, thus, restricted to the fluorophores in
                 the volume near the focal plane. This provides optical
                 sectioning and allows the use of regular cameras in the
                 detection process. Compared to confocal fluorescence
                 microscopy, LSFM reduces photo bleaching and photo toxicity by
                 up to three orders of magnitude. In LSFM, the specimen is

                 atrioventricular valve (AVV) morphogenesis and function is
                 crucial for understanding how congenital valve defects arise.
                 Here, we use high-speed fluorescence microscopy to investigate
                 AVV morphogenesis in zebrafish at cellular resolution. We find
                 that valve leaflets form directly through a process of
                 invagination, rather than first forming endocardial cushions.
                 There are three phases of valve function in embryonic
                 development. First, the atrioventricular canal (AVC) is closed
                 by the mechanical action of the myocardium, rolls together and
                 then relaxes. The growing valve leaflets serve to block the
                 canal during the roll and, depending on the developmental
                 stage, either expand or hang down as a leaflet to block the
                 canal. These steps are disrupted by the subtle morphological
                 changes that result from inhibiting ErbB-, TGFbeta-or Cox2
                 (Ptgs2)-dependent signaling. Cox2 inhibition affects valve
                 development due to its effect on myocardial cell size and
                 shape, which changes the morphology of the ventricle and
                 alters valve geometry. Thus, different signaling pathways
                 regulate distinct aspects of the behavior of individual cells
                 during valve morphogenesis, thereby influencing specific
                 facets of valve function.",

                 technological constrains and are unable to observe aquatic
                 microbes in their natural setting. In order to provide a
                 simple and easy to implement solution for such studies, a new
                 Thin Light Sheet Microscope (TLSM) has been developed. The
                 TLSM utilizes a well-defined sheet of laser light, which has a
                 narrow (23 micron) axial dimension over a 1 mm x 1 mm field of
                 view. This light sheet is positioned precisely within the
                 depth of field of the microscope's objective lens. The
                 technique thus utilizes conventional microscope optics but
                 replaces the illumination system. The advantages of the TLSM
                 are two-fold: First, it concentrates light only where
                 excitation is needed, thus maximizing the efficiency of the
                 illumination source. Secondly, the TLSM maximizes image
                 sharpness while at the same time minimizing the level of
                 background noise. Particles that are not located within the
                 objective's depth of field are not illuminated and therefore
                 do not contribute to an out-of-focus image. Images from a
                 prototype system that used SYBR Green I fluorescence stain in
                 order to localize single bacteria are reported. The bacteria
                 were in a relatively large and undisturbed volume of 4ml,
                 which contained natural seawater. The TLSM can be used for
                 fresh water studies of bacteria with no modification. The
                 microscope permits the observation of interactions at the
                 microscale and has potential to yield insights into how
                 microbes structure pelagic ecosystems.",

                 characterized by the constant and iterative formation of new
                 organs. Non-invasive time-resolved imaging of intact, fully
                 functional organisms allows studies of the dynamics involved
                 in shaping complex organisms. Conventional and confocal
                 fluorescence microscopy suffer from limitations when whole
                 living organisms are imaged at single-cell resolution. We
                 applied light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy to overcome
                 these limitations and study the dynamics of plant growth. We
                 designed a special imaging chamber in which the plant is
                 maintained vertically under controlled illumination with its
                 leaves in the air and its root in the medium. We show that
                 minimally invasive, multi-color, three-dimensional imaging of
                 live Arabidopsis thaliana samples can be achieved at organ,
                 cellular and subcellular scales over periods of time ranging
                 from seconds to days with minimal damage to the sample. We
                 illustrate the capabilities of the method by recording the
                 growth of primary root tips and lateral root primordia over
                 several hours. This allowed us to quantify the contribution of
                 cell elongation to the early morphogenesis of lateral root
                 primordia and uncover the diurnal growth rhythm of lateral
                 roots. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach at
                 varying spatial and temporal scales by following the division
                 of plant cells as well as the movement of single endosomes in
                 live growing root samples. This multi-dimensional approach
                 will have an important impact on plant developmental and cell
                 biology and paves the way to a truly quantitative description

  abstract    = "Classic histology still represents the gold standard in tumor
                 tissue analytics. However, two-dimensional analysis of single
                 tissue slides does not provide a representative overview of
                 the inhomogeneous tumor physiology, and a detailed analysis of
                 complex three-dimensional structures is not feasible with this
                 technique. To overcome this problem, we applied multispectral
                 fluorescence ultramicroscopy (UM) to the field of tumor
                 analysis. Optical sectioning of cleared tumor specimen
                 provides the possibility to three-dimensionally acquire
                 relevant tumor parameters on a cellular resolution. To analyze
                 the virtual UM tumor data sets, we created a novel set of
                 algorithms enabling the fully automatic segmentation and
                 quantification of multiple tumor parameters. This new
                 postmortem imaging technique was applied to determine the
                 therapeutic treatment effect of bevacizumab on the vessel
                 architecture of orthotopic KPL-4 breast cancer xenografts at
                 different time points. A significant reduction of the vessel
                 volume, number of vessel segments, and branching points in the
                 tumor periphery was already detectable 1 day after initiation
                 of treatment. These parameters remained virtually unchanged in
                 the center of the tumor. Furthermore, bevacizumab-induced
                 vessel normalization and reduction in vascular permeability
                 diminished the penetration behavior of trastuzumab-Alexa 750
                 into tumor tissue. Our results demonstrated that this
                 newimaging method enables the three-dimensional visualization
                 and fully automatic quantification of multiple tumor
                 parameters and drug penetration on a cellular level.
                 Therefore,UM is a valuable tool for cancer research and drug
                 development. It bridges the gap between common macroscopic and
                 microscopic imaging modalities and opens up new

                 induce long distance regeneration in the optic nerve. Thus, a
                 pressing question now is whether regenerating RGC axons can

                 assessing RGC axon regeneration use histological sectioning.

                 axonal trajectory and termination. To unequivocally evaluate

                 with PTEN/SOCS3 deletion, a condition known to promote robust
                 regeneration, axon growth followed tortuous paths through the
                 optic nerve, with many axons reversing course and extending
                 towards the eye. Such aberrant growth was prevalent in the
                 proximal region of the optic nerve where strong astroglial
                 activation is present. In the optic chiasms of PTEN/SOCS3
                 deletion mice and PTEN deletion/Zymosan/cAMP mice, many axons
                 project to the opposite optic nerve or to the ipsilateral
                 optic tract. Following bilateral optic nerve crush, similar
                 divergent trajectory is seen at the optic chiasm compared to
                 unilateral crush. Centrally, axonal projection is limited
                 predominantly to the hypothalamus. Together, we demonstrate
                 the applicability of LSFM for comprehensive assessment of
                 optic nerve regeneration, providing in-depth analysis of the
                 axonal trajectory and pathfinding. Our study indicates
                 significant axon misguidance in the optic nerve and brain, and
                 underscores the need for investigation of axon guidance
                 mechanisms during optic nerve regeneration in adults.",

                 at the larval stage make it a vertebrate model of choice for
                 brain-wide in-vivo functional imaging. However, current
                 point-scanning imaging techniques, such as two-photon or
                 confocal microscopy, impose a strong limit on acquisition
                 speed which in turn sets the number of neurons that can be
                 simultaneously recorded. At 5 Hz, this number is of the order
                 of one thousand, i.e., approximately 1-2\% of the brain. Here
                 we demonstrate that this limitation can be greatly overcome by
                 using Selective-plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM).
                 Zebrafish larvae expressing the genetically encoded calcium
                 indicator GCaMP3 were illuminated with a scanned laser sheet
                 and imaged with a camera whose optical axis was oriented
                 orthogonally to the illumination plane. This optical
                 sectioning approach was shown to permit functional imaging of
                 a very large fraction of the brain volume of 5-9-day-old
                 larvae with single- or near single-cell resolution. The
                 spontaneous activity of up to 5,000 neurons was recorded at 20
                 Hz for 20-60 min. By rapidly scanning the specimen in the
                 axial direction, the activity of 25,000 individual neurons
                 from 5 different z-planes (approximately 30\% of the entire
                 brain) could be simultaneously monitored at 4 Hz. Compared to
                 point-scanning techniques, this imaging strategy thus yields a
                 ≃20-fold increase in data throughput (number of recorded
                 neurons times acquisition rate) without compromising the
                 signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The extended field of view
                 offered by the SPIM method allowed us to directly identify
                 large scale ensembles of neurons, spanning several brain
                 regions, that displayed correlated activity and were thus
                 likely to participate in common neural processes. The benefits
                 and limitations of SPIM for functional imaging in zebrafish as
                 well as future developments are briefly discussed.",

                 time-lapse imaging of developmental processes lasting several
                 hours to a few days. The success of this promising technology
                 has mainly been limited by the lack of suitable techniques for
                 mounting fragile samples. Embedding zebrafish embryos in
                 agarose, which is common in conventional confocal microscopy,
                 has resulted in severe growth defects and unreliable results.
                 In this study, we systematically quantified the viability and
                 mobility of zebrafish embryos mounted under more suitable
                 conditions. We found that tubes made of fluorinated ethylene
                 propylene (FEP) filled with low concentrations of agarose or
                 methylcellulose provided an optimal balance between sufficient

              quantitative information must be obtained from large
              multicellular organisms on the cellular or even subcellular level
              and with a good temporal resolution. However, this usually
              requires a combination of conflicting features: high imaging
              speed, low photobleaching, and low phototoxicity in the specimen,
              good three-dimensional (3D) resolution, an excellent
              signal-to-noise ratio, and multiple-view imaging capability. The
              latter feature refers to the capability of recording a specimen
              along multiple directions, which is crucial for the imaging of
              large specimens with strong light-scattering or light-absorbing
              tissue properties. An imaging technique that fulfills these
              requirements is essential for many key applications: For example,
              studying fast cellular processes over long periods of time,
              imaging entire embryos throughout development, or reconstructing
              the formation of morphological defects in mutants. Here, we
              discuss digital scanned laser light sheet fluorescence microscopy
              (DSLM) as a novel tool for quantitative in vivo imaging in the
              post-genomic era and show how this emerging technique relates to
              the currently most widely applied 3D microscopy techniques in
              biology: confocal fluorescence microscopy and two-photon

                 crucial for the development and function of many organs.
                 Although 3D cell culture models have identified molecular
                 mechanisms controlling lumen formation in vitro, their
                 function during vertebrate organogenesis is poorly understood.
                 Using light sheet microscopy and genetic approaches we have
                 investigated single lumen formation in the zebrafish gut. Here
                 we show that during gut development multiple lumens open and
                 enlarge to generate a distinct intermediate, which consists of
                 two adjacent unfused lumens separated by basolateral contacts.
                 We observed that these lumens arise independently from each
                 other along the length of the gut and do not share a
                 continuous apical surface. Resolution of this intermediate
                 into a single, continuous lumen requires the remodeling of
                 contacts between adjacent lumens and subsequent lumen fusion.
                 We show that lumen resolution, but not lumen opening, is
                 impaired in smoothened (smo) mutants, indicating that
                 fluid-driven lumen enlargement and resolution are two distinct
                 processes. Furthermore, we show that smo mutants exhibit
                 perturbations in the Rab11 trafficking pathway and demonstrate
                 that Rab11-mediated trafficking is necessary for single lumen
                 formation. Thus, lumen resolution is a distinct genetically
                 controlled process crucial for single, continuous lumen
                 formation in the zebrafish gut.",

                 microfluidic channel and thus omits the necessity of flow
                 focusing and point scanning based technology. Another
                 advantage lies in the orthogonal detection geometry that
                 totally cuts-off the incident light, thereby substantially

              such samples as it records high-contrast images of entire planes
              within large samples at once. However, in order to obtain images
              of different planes, it has been necessary to move the sample

              lens. This mechanical movement limits speed, precision and may be

                 biological investigations of thick samples and it has recently
                 been demonstrated that it can also act as a suitable
                 architecture for super-resolution imaging of thick biological
                 samples by means of individual molecule localization. However,
                 imaging in depth is still limited since it suffers from a
                 reduction in image quality caused by scattering effects. This
                 paper sets out to investigate the advantages of non-linear
                 photoactivation implemented in a selective plane illumination
                 configuration when imaging scattering samples. In particular,
                 two-photon excitation is proven to improve imaging
                 capabilities in terms of imaging depth and is expected to
                 reduce light-sample interactions and sample photo-damage.
                 Here, two-photon photoactivation is coupled to individual
                 molecule localization methods based on light-sheet
                 illumination (IML-SPIM), allowing super-resolution imaging of

                 contrast. However, a decrease of the beam's waist also
                 decreases the illumination beam's depth of field. Here, we
                 introduce a new kind of beam that we call sectioned Bessel

                 developing embryos is an indispensable step towards such a
                 system-level understanding. In recent years, light-sheet
                 fluorescence microscopy has emerged as a particularly
                 promising strategy for recording the in vivo data required to
                 realize this goal. Using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy,
                 entire complex organisms can be rapidly imaged in three
                 dimensions at sub-cellular resolution, achieving high temporal
                 sampling and excellent signal-to-noise ratio without damaging
                 the living specimen or bleaching fluorescent markers. The
                 resulting datasets allow following individual cells in
                 vertebrate and higher invertebrate embryos over up to several

                 multi-terabyte recordings typically preclude comprehensive

                 cell behavior throughout embryonic development. We review
                 current efforts in light-sheet microscopy and bioimage
                 informatics towards this goal, and argue that comprehensive

  abstract = "Embryonic development is one of the most complex processes
              encountered in biology. In vertebrates and higher invertebrates,
              a single cell transforms into a fully functional organism
              comprising several tens of thousands of cells, arranged in
              tissues and organs that perform impressive tasks. In vivo
              observation of this biological process at high spatiotemporal
              resolution and over long periods of time is crucial for
              quantitative developmental biology. Importantly, such recordings
              must be realized without compromising the physiological
              development of the specimen. In digital scanned laser light-sheet
              fluorescence microscopy (DSLM), a specimen is rapidly scanned
              with a thin sheet of light while fluorescence is recorded
              perpendicular to the axis of illumination with a camera.
              Combining light-sheet technology and fast laser scanning, DSLM
              delivers quantitative data for entire embryos at high
              spatiotemporal resolution. Compared with confocal and two-photon
              fluorescence microscopy, DSLM exposes the embryo to at least
              three orders of magnitude less light energy, but still provides
              up to 50 times faster imaging speeds and a 10-100-fold higher
              signal-to-noise ratio. By using automated image processing
              algorithms, DSLM images of embryogenesis can be converted into a

              cells as a function of time, revealing cell fate as well as cell
              origin. By means of such analyses, developmental building plans
              of tissues and organs can be determined in a whole-embryo

                 throughout the whole brain is still challenging for imaging

                 transport, flow velocities and concentrations in an imaging

                 recording the fluorescence signal. Several types of image

                 as effective area per pixel, quantum efficiency, noise level

              is lower than its lateral resolution. The ratio is approximately

              1.2 -1.4) and more than 10 with low numerical apertures (NA 0.2
              and below). In biological imaging, the axial resolution is
              normally insufficient to resolve subcellular phenomena.
              Furthermore, parts of the images of opaque specimens are often
              highly degraded or obscured. Multiple-view fluorescence
              microscopy overcomes both problems simultaneously by recording
              multiple images of the same specimen along different directions.
              The images are digitally fused into a single high-quality image.
              Multiple-view imaging was developed as an extension to the
              light-sheet based fluorescence microscope (LSFM), a novel
              technique that seems to be better suited for multiple-view

                 difficulties in tracking single molecules on the apical
                 surface of a cell. We present here a three-dimensional (3D)
                 single particle tracking technique that is based on prism
                 coupled light-sheet microscopy (PCLSM). This novel design
                 provides a signal-to-noise ratio comparable to confocal
                 microscopy while it has the capability of illuminating at
                 arbitrary depth. We demonstrate tracking of single EGF
                 molcules on the apical surface of live cell membranes from
                 their binding to EGF receptors until they are internalized or
                 photobleached. We found that EGF exhibits multiple diffusion

                 the average diffusion coefficient of EGF on A549 cells was

                 light-sheet based 3D single particle tracking technique solves
                 the technique difficulty of tracking single particles on
                 apical membranes and is able to document the whole

                 is challenged by out-of-focus fluorescence excitation. To
                 reduce out-of-focus fluorescence we developed reflected
                 light-sheet microscopy (RLSM), a fluorescence microscopy
                 method allowing selective plane illumination throughout the
                 nuclei of living mammalian cells. A thin light sheet parallel
                 to the imaging plane and close to the sample surface is
                 generated by reflecting an elliptical laser beam incident from
                 the top by 90° with a small mirror. The thin light sheet
                 allows for an increased signal-to-background ratio superior to
                 that in previous illumination schemes and enables imaging of
                 single fluorescent proteins with up to 100-Hz time resolution.
                 We demonstrated the single-molecule sensitivity of RLSM by
                 measuring the DNA-bound fraction of glucocorticoid receptor
                 (GR) and determining the residence times on DNA of various
                 oligomerization states and mutants of GR and estrogen
                 receptor-$\alpha$ (ER), which permitted us to resolve
                 different modes of DNA binding of GR. We demonstrated
                 two-color single-molecule imaging by observing the
                 spatiotemporal colocalization of two different protein pairs.

                 biological processes, but it is challenging with current
                 techniques such as spinning-disk confocal microscopy. Bessel
                 beam plane illumination microscopy allows high-speed 3D live
                 fluorescence imaging of living cellular and multicellular
                 specimens with nearly isotropic spatial resolution, low
                 photobleaching and low photodamage. Unlike conventional
                 fluorescence imaging techniques that usually have a unique
                 operation mode, Bessel plane illumination has several modes
                 that offer different performance with different imaging
                 metrics. To achieve optimal results from this technique, the
                 appropriate operation mode needs to be selected and the
                 experimental setting must be optimized for the specific
                 application and associated sample properties. Here we explain

               in the last years. In fact, since optical sectioning is achieved
               in a wide-field detection scheme, this technique allows high
               resolution three-dimensional imaging with high frame rate. Light
               sheet microscopy is therefore an ideal candidate for
               reconstructing macroscopic specimens with micron resolution:
               coupled with clearing protocols based on refractive index
               matching it has been exploited to image entire mouse brains
               without physical sectioning. Use of clearing protocols poses
               several challenges to light sheet microscopy. First of all,
               residual light scattering inside the tissue expands the
               excitation light sheet, leading to the excitation of out-offocus
               planes, and thus frustrating the very principle of light sheet
               illumination. To reject out-of-focus contributions we recently
               coupled light sheet illumination with confocal detection,
               achieving significant contrast enhancement in real time. Another
               issue which often arises when working with clearing agents is
               the refractive index mismatch between the clearing and the
               medium objective design medium. This introduces severe spherical
               aberration, which leads to broadening of the point spread
               function and to a strong reduction in its peak value: When
               imaging deep (several mm) inside macroscopic specimens, the
               signal can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. We
               investigated the possibility of correcting such spherical
               aberration by introducing extra optical devices in the detection

                 motion estimation of biological structures in light
                 microscopy. It has also been used as a key module in
                 segmentation and tracking systems and is considered a mature
                 technology in the field of computer vision. However, most of
                 the research focused on 2D natural images, which are small in
                 size and rich in edges and texture information. In contrast,
                 3D time-lapse recordings of biological specimens comprise up
                 to several terabytes of image data and often exhibit complex
                 object dynamics as well as blurring due to the
                 point-spread-function of the microscope. Thus, new approaches
                 to optical flow are required to improve performance for such
                 data. RESULTS: We solve optical flow in large 3D time-lapse
                 microscopy datasets by defining a Markov random field (MRF)
                 over super-voxels in the foreground and applying motion
                 smoothness constraints between super-voxels instead of
                 voxel-wise. This model is tailored to the specific
                 characteristics of light microscopy datasets: super-voxels
                 help registration in textureless areas, the MRF over
                 super-voxels efficiently propagates motion information between
                 neighboring cells and the background subtraction and
                 super-voxels reduce the dimensionality of the problem by an
                 order of magnitude. We validate our approach on large 3D
                 time-lapse datasets of Drosophila and zebrafish development by
                 analyzing cell motion patterns. We show that our approach is,
                 on average, 10 \texttimes{} faster than commonly used optical
                 flow implementations in the Insight Tool-Kit (ITK) and reduces
                 the average flow end point error by 50\% in regions with
                 complex dynamic processes, such as cell divisions.

                 images of a simulated object into a single image in the
                 context of modern fluorescence microscopy techniques. RL
                 deconvolution can merge images with very different
                 point-spread functions, such as in multiview light-sheet
                 microscopes,1, 2 while preserving the best resolution
                 information present in each image. We show that RL
                 deconvolution is also easily applied to merge high-resolution,
                 high-noise images with low-resolution, low-noise images,
                 relevant when complementing conventional microscopy with
                 localization microscopy. We also use RL deconvolution to merge
                 images produced by different simulated illumination patterns,
                 relevant to structured illumination microscopy (SIM)3, 4 and
                 image scanning microscopy (ISM). The quality of our ISM
                 reconstructions is at least as good as reconstructions using
                 standard inversion algorithms for ISM data, but our method
                 follows a simpler recipe that requires no mathematical
                 insight. Finally, we apply RL deconvolution to merge a series
                 of ten images with varying signal and resolution levels. This
                 combination is relevant to gated stimulated-emission depletion
                 (STED) microscopy, and shows that merges of high-quality
                 images are possible even in cases for which a non-iterative
                 inversion algorithm is unknown.",

              to two-dimensional cell culture systems; that is, they are used
              in a cellular context that is defined by hard and flat surfaces.
              However, a physiological context is not found in single cells
              cultivated on coverslips. It requires the complex
              three-dimensional (3D) relationship of cells cultivated in
              extracellular matrix (ECM) gels, tissue sections, or in naturally
              developing organisms. In fact, the number of applications of 3D
              cell cultures in basic research as well as in drug discovery and
              toxicity testing has been increasing over the past few years.
              Unfortunately, the imaging of highly scattering multicellular
              specimens is still challenging. The main issues are the limited
              optical penetration depth, the phototoxicity, and the fluorophore
              bleaching. Light-sheet-based fluorescence microscopy (LSFM)
              overcomes many drawbacks of conventional fluorescence microscopy
              by using an orthogonal/azimuthal fluorescence arrangement with
              independent sets of lenses for illumination and detection. The
              basic idea is to illuminate the specimen from the side with a

                 tissues. Cells in real tissues interact through chemical and
                 mechanical stimuli with adjacent cells and via the
                 extracellular matrix. Such a highly interconnected
                 communication network extends along all three dimensions. This
                 architecture is lost in two-dimensional cultures. Therefore,
                 at least in many cases, two-dimensional cell monolayers do not
                 represent a suitable in vitro tool to characterize accurately
                 the biology of real tissues. Many studies performed over the
                 last few years have demonstrated that the differences between
                 three-dimensional and two-dimensional cultured cells are
                 striking at the morphological and molecular levels and that
                 three-dimensional cell cultures can be employed in order to
                 shrink the gap between real tissues and in vitro cell models.

                 stimulation. Fluorescence imaging of three-dimensional cell
                 cultures sets new challenges and imposes specific requirements
                 concerning the choice of a suitable microscopy technique. Deep

                 requirements. Light-sheet-based fluorescence microscopy (LSFM)

                 lining the neural tube cavity, or neurocoel, in wildtype and

                 extracellular matrix between the myocardial and endocardial
                 layers. We analyzed sco(te382) mutant hearts in detail using
                 both selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) and
                 transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and observed a
                 fascinating endocardial defect. Time-lapse SPIM imaging of
                 wild-type and mutant embryos revealed significant and dynamic
                 gaps between endocardial cells during development. Although
                 these gaps close in wild-type animals, they fail to close in
                 the mutants, ultimately leading to a near complete absence of
                 endocardial cells in the atrial chamber by the heart looping
                 stage. TEM analyses confirm the presence of gaps between
                 endocardial cells in sco mutants, allowing the apparent
                 leakage of cardiac jelly into the lumen. High-resolution
                 mapping places the sco(te382) mutation within the fbn2b locus,
                 which encodes the extracellular matrix protein Fibrillin 2b
                 (OMIM ID: 121050). Complementation and further phenotypic
                 analyses confirm that sco is allelic to puff daddy(gw1)
                 (pfd(gw1)), a null mutant in fbn2b, and that sco(te382) is a
                 hypomorphic allele of fbn2b. fbn2b belongs to a family of
                 genes responsible for the assembly of microfibrils throughout
                 development, and is essential for microfibril structural
                 integrity. In sco(te382) mutants, Fbn2b is disabled by a
                 missense mutation in a highly conserved cbEGF domain, which
                 likely interferes with protein folding. Integrating data
                 obtained from microscopy and molecular biology, we posit that
                 this mutation impacts the rigidity of Fbn2b, imparting a
                 structural defect that weakens endocardial adhesion thereby
                 resulting in perforated endocardium.",

                 mesenchyme and growth expansion occur in close proximity to
                 cardiovascular tissues. To date, research on thyroid

                 shape and location relative to adjacent cardiovascular tissues

                 thyroid-specific expression of a membrane version of mCherry

                 a high coordination was revealed between thyroid organogenesis

                 found to proceed in intimate contact with the distal
                 ventricular myocardium and live imaging confirmed that thyroid
                 budding from the pharyngeal floor is tightly coordinated with

  abstract    = "The critical issue of all fluorescence microscopes is the
                 efficient use of the fluorophores, i.e., to detect as many
                 photons from the excited fluorophores as possible, as well as
                 to excite only the fluorophores that are in focus. This issue
                 is addressed in EMBL's implementation of a light sheet based
                 microscope [single plane illumination microscope (SPIM)],
                 which illuminates only the fluorophores in the focal plane of
                 the detection objective lens. The light sheet is a beam that
                 is collimated in one and focused in the other direction. Since
                 no fluorophores are excited outside the detectors' focal
                 plane, the method also provides intrinsic optical sectioning.
                 The total number of observable time points can be improved by
                 several orders of magnitude when compared to a confocal
                 fluorescence microscope. The actual improvement factor depends
                 on the number of planes acquired and required to achieve a
                 certain signal to noise ratio. A SPIM consists of five basic
                 units, which address (1) light detection, (2) illumination of
                 the specimen, (3) generation of an appropriate beam of light,
                 (4) translation and rotation of the specimen, and finally (5)
                 control of different mechanical and electronic parts, data
                 collection, and postprocessing of the data. We first describe
                 the basic building units of EMBL's SPIM and its most relevant
                 properties. We then cover the basic principles underlying this
                 instrument and its unique properties such as the efficient
                 usage of the fluorophores, the reduced photo toxic effects,
                 the true optical sectioning capability, and the excellent
                 axial resolution. We also discuss how an isotropic resolution
                 can be achieved. The optical setup, the control hardware, and
                 the control scheme are explained in detail. We also describe
                 some less obvious refinements of the basic setup that result
                 in an improved performance. The properties of the instrument
                 are demonstrated by images of biological samples that were

                 unidirectionally throughout the organism. Defects in this

                 conduction development may help to prevent these devastating
                 clinical outcomes. Utilizing a cardiac-specific fluorescent
                 calcium indicator zebrafish transgenic line,
                 Tg(cmlc2:gCaMP)(s878), that allows for in vivo optical mapping

                 the fast conduction network of this specialized electrical
                 system. To identify novel regulators of the CCS, we designed

                 repolarization that predisposes affected individuals to lethal
                 cardiac arrhythmias. To date, an appropriate animal model of
                 inherited LQTS does not exist. The zebrafish is a powerful
                 vertebrate model used to dissect molecular pathways of
                 cardiovascular development and disease. Because fundamental
                 electrical properties of the zebrafish heart are remarkably
                 similar to those of the human heart, the zebrafish may be an
                 appropriate model for studying human inherited arrhythmias.
                 Here we describe the molecular, cellular, and
                 electrophysiological basis of a zebrafish mutant characterized
                 by ventricular asystole. Genetic mapping and direct sequencing
                 identify the affected gene as kcnh2, which encodes the channel
                 responsible for the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K(+)
                 current (I(Kr)). We show that complete loss of functional
                 I(Kr) in embryonic hearts leads to ventricular cell membrane
                 depolarization, inability to generate action potentials (APs),
                 and disrupted calcium release. A small hyperpolarizing current
                 restores spontaneous APs, implying wild-type function of other
                 ionic currents critical for AP generation. Heterozygous fish
                 manifest overt cellular and electrocardiographic evidence for
                 delayed ventricular repolarization. Our findings provide
                 insight into the pathogenesis of homozygous kcnh2 mutations

                 cells from the precursor vessel, followed by vessel
                 segregation. These processes were regulated by the ligand
                 EphrinB2 and its receptor EphB4, which are expressed in
                 arterial-fated and venous-fated progenitors, respectively, and
                 interact to orient the direction of progenitor migration.
                 Thus, directional control of progenitor migration drives

               technique that enables live imaging of large biological
               specimens in their entirety. By imaging the living biological
               sample from multiple angles SPIM has the potential to achieve
               isotropic resolution throughout even relatively large biological
               specimens. For every angle, however, only a relatively shallow
               section of the specimen is imaged with high resolution, whereas
               deeper regions appear increasingly blurred. In order to produce
               a single, uniformly high resolution image, we propose here an
               image mosaicing algorithm that combines state of the art
               groupwise image registration for alignment with content-based
               image fusion to prevent degrading of the fused image due to
               regional blurring of the input images. For the registration
               stage, we introduce an application-specific groupwise
               transformation model that incorporates per-image as well as
               groupwise transformation parameters. We also propose a new
               fusion algorithm based on Gaussian filters, which is
               substantially faster than fusion based on local image entropy.

                 processes, very little is known about their dynamic and
                 mechanical properties in physiological three-dimensional
                 environments. The conventional model of microtubule dynamic
                 instability postulates two dynamic microtubule states, growth
                 and shrinkage. However, several studies have indicated that
                 such a model does not provide a comprehensive quantitative and
                 qualitative description of microtubule behavior. Using
                 three-dimensional laser light-sheet fluorescence microscopy
                 and a three-dimensional sample preparation in spacious Teflon
                 cylinders, we measured microtubule dynamic instability and
                 elasticity in interphase Xenopus laevis egg extracts. Our data
                 are inconsistent with a two-state model of microtubule dynamic
                 instability and favor an extended four-state model with two
                 independent metastable pause states over a three-state model
                 with a single pause state. Moreover, our data on kinetic state
                 transitions rule out a simple GTP cap model as the driving
                 force of microtubule stabilization in egg extracts on
                 timescales of a few seconds or longer. We determined the
                 three-dimensional elastic properties of microtubules as a
                 function of both the contour length and the dynamic state. Our
                 results indicate that pausing microtubules are less flexible
                 than growing microtubules and suggest a growth-speed-dependent
                 persistence length. These data might hint toward mechanisms
                 that enable microtubules to efficiently perform multiple
                 different tasks in the cell and suggest the development of a
                 unified model of microtubule dynamics and microtubule

                 tremendously during recent years. Traditional tomography uses
                 absorption as the contrast mechanism, but for many purposes
                 its sensitivity is limited. The introduction of diffraction,
                 small-angle scattering, refraction, and phase contrasts has
                 increased the sensitivity, especially in materials composed of
                 light elements (for example, carbon and oxygen). X-ray
                 spectroscopy, in principle, offers information on element
                 composition and chemical environment. However, its application
                 in 3D imaging over macroscopic length scales has not been

                 of entire transparent organs without sectioning represents a
                 major advance in the field. We recently developed a highly

                 processes that often cannot be replicated in vitro. Intravital
                 imaging aims at quantifying changes in tissue architecture or
                 subcellular organization over time during organ development,
                 regeneration or degeneration. A general feature of this
                 approach is its reliance on the optical isolation of defined
                 cell types in the whole animals by transgenic expression of
                 fluorescent markers. Here we describe a simple and robust
                 method to analyze sensory hair-cell development and
                 regeneration in the zebrafish lateral line by high-resolution
                 intravital imaging using laser-scanning confocal microscopy

                 main advantage of studying hair-cell regeneration in the
                 lateral line is that it occurs throughout the life of the
                 animal, which allows its study in the most natural context. We
                 detail protocols to achieve continuous videomicroscopy for up
                 to 68 hours, enabling direct observation of cellular behavior,
                 which can provide a sensitive assay for the quantitative

                 Most available algorithms that provide sufficient segmentation
                 quality, however, are infeasible for a large amount of data
                 due to their high complexity. In this contribution we present
                 a fast parallelized segmentation method that is especially
                 suited for the extraction of stained nuclei from microscopy
                 images, e.g., of developing zebrafish embryos. The idea is to
                 transform the input image based on gradient and normal
                 directions in the proximity of detected seed points such that
                 it can be handled by straightforward global thresholding like
                 Otsu's method. We evaluate the quality of the obtained
                 segmentation results on a set of real and simulated benchmark
                 images in 2D and 3D and show the algorithm's superior
                 performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. We
                 achieve an up to ten-fold decrease in processing times,

               optical method for the observation of living specimens. Although
               this concept was established a century ago it is only during the
               last decade that instruments suitable for biological
               applications have been developed, thereby circumventing some of
               the limitations of established fluorescence imaging techniques
               such as confocal laser scanning microscopy. LSFM utilizes a
               sheet of laser light to illuminate only a thin slice of a
               fluorescently labeled sample. A wide-field fluorescence
               microscope, placed perpendicular to the light-sheet, serves to
               collect the fluorescence signal and image the observed region by
               means of a camera. This side-on illumination configuration
               features several advantages, including intrinsic optical
               sectioning without the need of spatial filtering as employed in
               confocal microscopy, excellent signal-to-noise ratio, high
               temporal resolution, and drastically reduced overall
               photobleaching and phototoxicity inside living specimens.
               Moreover, the non-conventional geometry of LSFM opens up a
               completely new way of sample mounting, enabling convenient
               multi-view image acquisition for 3D imaging by simple rotation
               of the sample within the medium-filled chamber. Although LSFM
               was developed originally for the observation of large organisms
               such as zebrafish embryos, this method can be adapted to a large
               range of samples from macroscopic specimens like corals or
               copepods to microscopic organisms like tintinnids.",

              based on Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) with the major
              difference that there is a translation of the sample in the
              vertical direction during the image acquisition process,
              requiring a new approach to image reconstruction. Contrary to
              OPT, hOPT makes possible to obtain 3D-optical images of intact
              long samples without imposing limits on the sample length. This
              has been tested using hOPT to image long murine tissue samples

                 are essential for processes such as nuclear organization and
                 signaling in cell division, differentiation and migration. To
                 understand these mechanisms, spatially resolved quantitative

                 fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements and
                 use it to visualize the diffusion and interactions of proteins

                 The light sheet geometry, where the camera is oriented

                 method of eliminating some of the scattered light and

                 achieved by illuminating the sample orthogonally to the

                 However, light scattering within the sample often deteriorates
                 the optical sectioning effect. Here, we demonstrate that
                 contrast and degree of confocality can greatly be increased by
                 combining scanned light sheet fluorescence excitation and
                 confocal slit detection. A high frame rate was achieved by
                 using the ``rolling shutter'' of a scientific CMOS camera as a
                 slit detector. Synchronizing the ``rolling shutter'' with the

                 which clusters of ventricular cardiomyocytes extrude and
                 expand into the cardiac jelly to form sheet-like projections.
                 Although it has been suggested that cardiac trabeculae enhance
                 cardiac contractility and intra-ventricular conduction, their
                 exact function in heart development has not been directly
                 addressed. We found that in zebrafish erbb2 mutants, which we
                 show completely lack cardiac trabeculae, cardiac function is
                 significantly compromised, with mutant hearts exhibiting
                 decreased fractional shortening and an immature conduction
                 pattern. To begin to elucidate the cellular mechanisms of
                 ErbB2 function in cardiac trabeculation, we analyzed erbb2

                 is initiated by directional cardiomyocyte migration rather
                 than oriented cell division, and that ErbB2 cell-autonomously

                 Axiomat using a stage with a computer-controlled stepping
                 motor for movement in the z-axis. The tilting device on the
                 Axiomat stage could turn a cell nucleus through any desired
                 angle and also provide movement in the x-y direction. The
                 technique was applied to 3-D imaging of human lymphocyte cell
                 nuclei, which were labelled by in situ hybridization with the
                 DNA probe pUC 1.77 (mainly specific for chromosome 1). For
                 each nucleus, 3-D data sets were registered at viewing angles
                 of 0 degrees, 90 degrees and 180 degrees; the volumes and
                 positions of the labelled regions (spots) were calculated. The
                 results also confirm that, in principle, any angle of a 2 pi
                 geometry can be fixed for data acquisition with a high
                 reproducibility. This indicates the feasibility of

                 samples with astounding quality and resolution. However,

                 transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel is a key

                 of CFTR function leads to cystic fibrosis [1, 3, 4], a disease
                 that affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestine, and vas
                 deferens. Conversely, uncontrolled activation of the channel
                 leads to increased fluid secretion and plays a major role in
                 several diseases and conditions including cholera [5, 6] and
                 other secretory diarrheas [7] as well as polycystic kidney
                 disease [8-10]. Understanding how CFTR activity is regulated
                 in vivo has been limited by the lack of a genetic model. Here,
                 we used a forward genetic approach in zebrafish to uncover

                 accumulation of fluid due to the uncontrolled activation of
                 the CFTR channel. Analyses in zebrafish larvae and mammalian
                 cells indicate that Cse1l is a negative regulator of
                 CFTR-dependent fluid secretion. This work demonstrates the

                 through-focal section views of the same object to provide a
                 solution to this problem. A tilting specimen stage was
                 constructed for an optical microscope, which with the use of a
                 coverslip-free water immersion lens, allowed the collection of
                 data sets from intact Drosophila melanogaster embryos at
                 viewing directions up to 90 degrees apart. We have devised an
                 image processing scheme to determine the relative tilt,
                 translation, and sampling parameters of the different data
                 sets. This involves the use of a modified phase
                 cross-correlation function, which produces a very sharp
                 maximum. Finally the data sets are merged using
                 figure-of-merit and local area scaling techniques borrowed

                 microscopy which improves quantitative imaging especially in
                 cytogenetic applications by means of defined sample rotation
                 under the microscope objective. The advantage of micro-axial
                 tomography is an effective improvement of the precision of
                 distance measurements between point-like objects. Under
                 certain circumstances, the effective (3D) resolution can be
                 improved by optimized acquisition depending on subsequent,
                 multi-perspective image recording of the same objects followed
                 by reconstruction methods. This requires, however, a very
                 precise alignment of the tilted views. We present a novel
                 feature-based image alignment method with a precision better
                 than the full width at half maximum of the point spread
                 function. The features are the positions (centres of gravity)
                 of all fluorescent objects observed in the images (e.g. cell
                 nuclei, fluorescent signals inside cell nuclei, fluorescent
                 beads, etc.). Thus, real alignment precision depends on the
                 localization precision of these objects. The method
                 automatically determines the corresponding objects in
                 subsequently tilted perspectives using a weighted bipartite
                 graph. The optimum transformation function is computed in a
                 least squares manner based on the coordinates of the centres
                 of gravity of the matched objects. The theoretically feasible
                 precision of the method was calculated using
                 computer-generated data and confirmed by tests on real image
                 series obtained from data sets of 200 nm fluorescent
                 nano-particles. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are
                 its speed and accuracy, which means that if enough objects are
                 included, the real alignment precision is better than the
                 axial localization precision of a single object. The alignment
                 precision can be assessed directly from the algorithm's
                 output. Thus, the method can be applied not only for image
                 alignment and object matching in tilted view series in order
                 to reconstruct (3D) images, but also to validate the
                 experimental performance (e.g. mechanical precision of the
                 tilting). In practice, the key application of the method is an
                 improvement of the effective spatial (3D) resolution, because
                 the well-known spatial anisotropy in light microscopy can be
                 overcome. This allows more precise distance measurements
                 between point-like objects.",

                 optical axis points into different directions relative to the
                 sample. A new technique for a simultaneous reconstruction from
                 a number of such axial tomographic confocal data sets was
                 developed and used for high resolution reconstruction of
                 3D-data both from experimental and virtual microscopic data
                 sets. The reconstructed images have a highly improved 3D
                 resolution, which is comparable to the lateral resolution of a
                 single deconvolved data set. Axial tomographic imaging in
                 combination with simultaneous data reconstruction also opens
                 the possibility for a more precise quantification of 3D data.

                 the acquisition of otherwise inaccessible spatial information

                 method can fundamentally improve the effective
                 three-dimensional (3D) resolution. In this report we present a
                 novel method for high resolution reconstruction of confocal
                 axial tomographic data. The method automatically determines
                 the relative angles of rotation, aligns the data from
                 different rotational views and reconstructs a single high
                 resolution 3D dataset. The reconstruction makes use of a known
                 point spread function and is based on an unconstrained maximum
                 likelihood deconvolution performed simultaneously from
                 multiple (in our case three) angular views. It was applied to
                 simulated as well as to experimental confocal datasets. The

                 organogenesis, the morphogenetic mechanisms that carve the
                 architecture of the vertebrate optic cup remain largely
                 unknown. Understanding how the hemispheric shape of an eye is
                 formed requires addressing the fundamental problem of how
                 individual cell behaviour is coordinated to direct epithelial
                 morphogenesis. Here, we analyze the role of ojoplano (opo), an
                 uncharacterized gene whose human ortholog is associated with
                 orofacial clefting syndrome, in the morphogenesis of
                 epithelial tissues. Most notably, when opo is mutated in
                 medaka fish, optic cup folding is impaired. We characterize
                 optic cup morphogenesis in vivo and determine at the cellular
                 level how opo affects this process. opo encodes a
                 developmentally regulated transmembrane protein that localizes
                 to compartments of the secretory pathway and to basal end-feet
                 of the neuroepithelial precursors. We show that Opo regulates
                 the polarized localization of focal adhesion components to the
                 basal cell surface. Furthermore, tissue-specific interference
                 with integrin-adhesive function impairs optic cup folding,
                 resembling the ocular phenotype observed in opo mutants. We
                 propose a model of retinal morphogenesis whereby opo-mediated
                 formation of focal contacts is required to transmit the
                 mechanical tensions that drive the macroscopic folding of the

                 conventional 3D optical imaging where the focal plane is

                 algorithm performs a precise 3D alignment, and a model-based
                 minimum mean squared algorithm synthesizes a montage,
                 combining the content of both the 3D views. Experiments with
                 images of individual neurones contrasted with a space-filling
                 fluorescent dye in thick brain tissue slices produced precise
                 3D montages that are corrected for depth-dependent signal
                 attenuation. The SNR of the reconstructed image is maximized
                 by the method, and it is significantly higher than in the
                 single views after applying our attenuation model. We also
                 compare our method with simpler two-view reconstruction
                 methods and quantify the SNR improvement. The reconstructed
                 images are a more faithful qualitative visualization of the
                 specimen's structure and are quantitatively more accurate,
                 providing a more rigorous basis for automated image analysis.",

                 to a light sheet by a single cylindrical lens. A light sheet

               is being scanned through that plane. Thus, the out-of-focus

               photographs show high resolution throughout the depth of scan.
               The mechanism of scanning is somewhat similar to the

                 and their influence is particularly large for promising
                 techniques such as light-sheet microscopy. In principle, image
                 quality might be improved by adaptive optics (AO), in which
                 aberrations are corrected by using a deformable mirror (DM).
                 To implement AO in microscopy, one requires a method to
                 measure wavefront aberrations, but the most commonly used
                 methods have limitations for samples lacking point-source
                 emitters. Here we implement an image-based wavefront-sensing
                 technique, a variant of generalized phase-diverse imaging
                 called multiframe blind deconvolution, and exploit it to
                 calibrate a DM in a light-sheet microscope. We describe two
                 methods of parameterizing the influence of the DM on
                 aberrations: a traditional Zernike expansion requiring 1040
                 parameters, and a direct physical model of the DM requiring
                 just 8 or 110 parameters. By randomizing voltages on all
                 actuators, we show that the Zernike expansion successfully
                 predicts wavefronts to an accuracy of approximately 30 nm
                 (rms) even for large aberrations. We thus show that
                 image-based wavefront sensing, which requires no additional
                 optical equipment, allows a simple but powerful method to

                 stroke, where it has been implicated in tissue damage as well
                 as in repair. Imaging technologies that specifically visualize
                 these processes are highly desirable. In this study, we
                 explored whether the inflammatory receptor CD40 can be
                 noninvasively and specifically visualized in mice after
                 cerebral ischemia using a fluorescent monoclonal antibody,
                 which we labeled with the near-infrared fluorescence dye Cy5.5
                 (Cy5.5-CD40MAb). METHODS: Wild-type and CD40-deficient mice
                 were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.
                 Mice were either intravenously injected with Cy5.5-CD40MAb or
                 control Cy5.5-IgGMAb. Noninvasive and ex vivo near-infrared
                 fluorescence imaging was performed after injection of the
                 compounds. Probe distribution and specificity was further
                 assessed with single-plane illumination microscopy,
                 immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy. RESULTS:
                 Significantly higher fluorescence intensities over the
                 stroke-affected hemisphere, compared to the contralateral
                 side, were only detected noninvasively in wild-type mice that
                 received Cy5.5-CD40MAb, but not in CD40-deficient mice
                 injected with Cy5.5-CD40MAb or in wild-type mice that were
                 injected with Cy5.5-IgGMAb. Ex vivo near-infrared fluorescence
                 showed an intense fluorescence within the ischemic territory
                 only in wild-type mice injected with Cy5.5-CD40MAb. In the
                 brains of these mice, single-plane illumination microscopy
                 demonstrated vascular and parenchymal distribution, and
                 confocal microscopy revealed a partial colocalization of
                 parenchymal fluorescence from the injected Cy5.5-CD40MAb with
                 activated microglia and blood-derived cells in the ischemic
                 region. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that a
                 CD40-targeted fluorescent antibody enables specific
                 noninvasive detection of the inflammatory receptor CD40 after
                 cerebral ischemia using optical techniques.",

  abstract    = "The Popeye domain containing (Popdc) genes encode a family of
                 transmembrane proteins with an evolutionary conserved Popeye
                 domain. These genes are abundantly expressed in striated
                 muscle tissue, however their function is not well understood.
                 In this study we have investigated the role of the popdc2 gene
                 in zebrafish. Popdc2 transcripts were detected in the
                 embryonic myocardium and transiently in the craniofacial and
                 tail musculature. Morpholino oligonucleotide-mediated
                 knockdown of popdc2 resulted in aberrant development of
                 skeletal muscle and heart. Muscle segments in the trunk were
                 irregularly shaped and craniofacial muscles were severely
                 reduced or even missing. In the heart, pericardial edema was
                 prevalent in the morphants and heart chambers were elongated
                 and looping was abnormal. These pathologies in muscle and
                 heart were alleviated after reducing the morpholino
                 concentration. However the heart still was abnormal displaying
                 cardiac arrhythmia at later stages of development. Optical
                 recordings of cardiac contractility revealed irregular
                 ventricular contractions with a 2:1, or 3:1 atrial/ventricular
                 conduction ratio, which caused a significant reduction in
                 heart frequency. Recordings of calcium transients with high
                 spatiotemporal resolution using a transgenic calcium indicator
                 line (Tg(cmlc2:gCaMP)(s878)) and SPIM microscopy confirmed the
                 presence of a severe arrhythmia phenotype. Our results
                 identify popdc2 as a gene important for striated muscle
                 differentiation and cardiac morphogenesis. In addition it is
                 required for the development of the cardiac conduction system.",

                 suffers from a fundamental problem of poor contrast with
                 increasing depth, as the illuminating light gets attenuated
                 and scattered and hence can not penetrate through thick

                 attenuation and scattering varies exponentially across the

                 alone are not suitable for the restoration of uneven
